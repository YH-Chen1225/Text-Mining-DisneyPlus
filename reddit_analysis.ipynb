       "'Keeps skipping/fast-forwarding -.- PS4 app - Ireland.No 4K content in the UK.When I click on a show, I can’t go down to scroll through the episodes.  Anyone else having that issue?The Disney plus app allows you to change your email / password on the app itself without email authentication. What the hell is this? Are we in 2005? This is surely a massive security issue if someone got my password.Items disappearing off watch list?Disney+ finally came out of the Uk and I added quite a lot of stuff into my watch list but half of it isn’t appearing? There’s some things I remember adding like the simpsons and avatar and they just aren’t appearing? Only the last like 50 things I added are on there. If I go onto something like the Simpsons then the watchlist button is there with a tick on it. Anyone know what’s up?I can\\'t connect to disney plus on android phone or firestick over wifi but it works over mobile data. It works fine over wifi through chrome on my laptop so not sure what\\'s going on.I\\'ve been excited as anyone to watch some content on Disney+ in UHD but for some reason I\\'m only getting the option to watch content (thing such as the latest avengers) in HD and not UHD. HDR gets enabled, but that\\'s all.I have a fast enough internet connection (74 Mbps) and I\\'ve tried using a wired connection as well as connected via WIFI like it usually is.My TV has the latest firmware, so I\\'m kind of stumped on what to do when I can see it working for some people.Getting no 4k or HDR on Xbox one x, I’m set up on Netflix and Prime with 4k etc. Any suggestions? Dublin, Ireland.No Dolby Atmos on Apple TV or LG OLED App in Tv. Deleted and reinstalled Disney+ App and now program contents (Star Wars/Marvel) description shows only 5.1 whereas before it showed Atmos. Any suggestions or ideas as to how to fix or is it a Disney+ issue?Thanks folks.Watching Mandalorian last night, the colour/brightness had some odd flickering. Might have been the Dolby Vision. Colours would suddenly pop a little more, in and out.  Watching something else in HDR10, this issue wasnt there.  Via LG OLED app. Possibly down to the bandwidth restrictions in the UK?Why no Dolby Atmos on Sony Android TVs.Yesterday  Disney+ has been released in my country (Italy), and at the moment I  can watch its contents only via PC browser (my TV is too old for the dedicated app, so I will buy a Fire Stick).I  saw a few posts in which people said that it\\'s impossible to watch  films and shows in 4K on the browser, but I\\'m confused because of this  statement (found making some searches on Google about the resolution cap  on PC browsers):>**Microsoft Edge:**  Up to 4K (requires HDCP 2.2-compliant  connection to a 4K display, with  at least Intel’s 7th-gen Core CPU, plus  the latest version of Windows)As far as I know, I satisfy all the \"requirements\":* my TV (Samsung JU series) should be compatible with HDCP, and I\\'m using a high-speed HDMI cable to connect it to the PC* my CPU is an i7-9700K* if I try to update Windows it can\\'t find any update (Windows 10 Home, 1909 version)Yesterday  I saw one episode of *The Mandalorian,* and it wasn\\'t in 4K (I know that because I usually watch Netflix in 4K and so I can tell the difference).So, what do you think about this situation?The audio is too low, although I set it both in windows and in the streaming at 100%. How can I fix it? I\\'m using Flight Hyperx wifi headphones (Google Chrome (latest update) / W10 with latest update)Hey I just wanted to know if anyone else is experiencing these. I\\'m on a Samsung s9+:- Downloads randomly say no network available even though there is- Downloads stop after a randem period of time- After a download stopped working, pausing and then unpausing only sometime works. Mostly the download gets sent to the queue.- Downloads all show as in queue and none are downloading.- Downloading causes my phone to quite literally burn up- Did I mention it\\'s a battery hog? Charging and discharging are the same while Disney plus is open. - Having the Disney plus app open makes it slow down after a random time period (probably due to CPU throttling because of the heat)- Download playback loading times while other movies are downloading are VERY slow.- Download playback gets to the point where I see and hear at around 10 fps- The app crashes constantly- Controlling downloads via the notifications doesn\\'t work- Pretty much every Aspekt of the app is broken in some way. I could go on but I think you guys get my point. I\\'ve LITERALLY been trying to download 10 movies since yesterday evening (that\\'s 26 hours now) and honestly I\\'m getting kind of annoyed. At some point I had half downloaded but decided to reinstall the app. It didn\\'t help.Ive reinstalled twice, force closed more times than I can count (cuz my phone was overheating so badly my hand was burning).I mean I\\'m in Germany where it only just released. But I guess it\\'s been out in the US of A for way longer than 2 days. So why then?How much did you reduce the quality in Germany?The Quality on my PC (QHD/Latest Chrome/300mbits) is really bad! I would say that are max. 720p noticeably less than 60fps...Keep getting error code 39I\\'ve got an Fire TV Stick Gen 2 (the one without 4k) but with Disney Plus I only get 720p while Netflix, Prime Video, ... give me 1080p. I live in GermanyNo app on my Phillips TV, will not work on my rockchip Android box when I cast from my phone video drops but audio remains. No switch app.Really struggling to watch on anything but my phone or browser and that\\'s not how I enjoy movies. Might have to cancel until I can actually watch itSky Q app for Disney + just isn’t working, it’s just a loading screen. I’ve paid to be able to watch things on tv??? Rebooted sky, turned everything off and on, updated software, refreshed apps I’ve done absolutely everything it just doesn’t workI still cant use Disney+ on any of our fire devices. We\\'ve tried everything under the sun for both our fire stick and our Toshiba FireTV and Disney+ just stopped working on both of them last week, open the app and it just has the logo with the spinning circle. Went through everything with Disney tech support and they couldnt fix it. I guess we\\'re going to have to cancel our subscription until this issue gets fixed, sucks because my kids have really grown fond of a lot of the stuff on there (esp Bluey), not to mention they\\'re dying to watch Frozen 2 again, didnt get a chance to watch it on Disney+.Xbox One X, 4K without HDR help.Hi, I was wondering if anyone would be able to help. I\\'m in the UK just got Disney Plus, I\\'m using it a Xbox One X on a 4K PC monitor, a Samsung U32J590, it\\'s 4K but not HDR. Everything is working in 4K except the Disney Plus, Netflix, YouTube, gaming, etc. Does anyone know if Disney Plus 4K only works if it\\'s 4K and HDR? Or does anyone have any setting recommendations to put the Xbox or monitor in to get Disney Plus to turn on 4K.

I read the notice that this is due to the Corona data-saving effort here in the EU. However,,,the difference in bitrate between DD5.1 and DD+Atmos should be pretty negligible. I would love to hear from Disney why they think saving 200Kbit/s is worth removing Atmos from any and all content...Thanks.Being told my payment method is about to expire when I have an annual subscription and my card won\\'t expire for months.Are different browsers and/or different users on the same computer counted as different devices for the ten devices limit?Is there anyway to lower the video quality?

Logging in not retained, when exiting the app (not signing out) on next launch it prompts for email and password again. But much more serious, the app crashes while watching content - app says out of memory and needs to restart. I’ve ensured all other apps are fully closed when launching the app. Also found that on a 4k Fire TV (not stick) the content only streams in HD not 4k (as per the LG app above)LG Oled C7 user here, in Europe. I noticed in the first episode of Mandalorian the brightness and/or black level adjusting mid-scene, during both bright and dark scenes. Depending on the picture content it occurs regularly every few seconds or so.I\\'m using the cinema home picture profile and turned off most of the relevant picture enhancers like dynamic contrast or ambient brightness. The Mandalorian plays in Dolby Vision on the C7 Oled. Anyone else notice this?Does anyone have a problem with it keep changing languages or is it me doing something stupid?Hey,I just got Disney+ here in Germany and was wondering if it has Atmos? The internet and most people on here seem to say that it doesn\\'t but viewing a title (Aladin for instance) shows the Dolby Atmos logo on the xbox. Is that just a default, or does it mean it actually also plays in Atmos?There is definitely sound coming out of the ceiling speakers, but I\\'m not sure whether or not that is due to the movie actually having an Atmos soundtrack, or just the conversion of the receiver.Thanks for your help!Ireland, XboxHow to add things to my watchlist?

Already contacted Disney support, they really didn\\'t care.[https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/fomn2o/theres\\\\_some\\\\_serious\\\\_issue\\\\_with\\\\_disney\\\\_where/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/fomn2o/theres_some_serious_issue_with_disney_where/)I\\'m using an android TV box which is running an up to date version of android, but I was initially getting the \"device not supported\" message on Googles play store.I have now managed to install it, but was initially getting no sound. I did some googleing and found this was down to the auto setting for the audio, which I changed. Now I get sound and no picture.I\\'ve tried every display setting on the system to no avail.Anyone know how to fix this?Hey everybody!I friend of mine came up with this problem and can\\'t fix is somehow. Maybe you guys have an idea or a solution even to this.  Everything is colored, just like it should be, but as soon as she wants to watch a movie or a TV show, it turns black and white. But its only the movie it self, everything else is normal, even the little picture that is shown when ever you want to skip forward etc.   She\\'s watching this on a smart TV from Sony. Already uninstalled the app and installed it again. Every other device in her household works just fine. She told me, that she already called the support from Disney+ and the told her, to call Sony, and they can\\'t help either. Shoot me with questions, when ever you need additional information!Now I\\'m here, and asking for help :)   Thanks already!Hi,  there is an audio problem on Android TV app.  Xiaomi MiBox 4S updated to latest version and connected through HDMI to a latest generation Marantz amplifier that supports DolbyDigital+, yet movies from Disney+ Android TV app stream only in stereo sound.  On the same device, Netflix and Amazon Video movies stream in 5.1 DolbyDigital+ sound.

I recap:  \\\\- Android smartphone app through Chromecast: 5.1  \\\\- iOS smartphone app through Chromecast: 5.1  \\\\- Android TV app (Sony TV, Philips TV, Xiaomi MiBox 4s, Nvidia Shield): stereo  I ask for clarification: it seems it\\'s a problem with ONLY the Disney+ Android TV app.  ThanksPreface this by saying Im watching on. LGB8 55\" OLED. Watched the first episode of The Mandolorian and it seems there is a delay in the brightness levels? When a scene changes from dark to bright you can see the whole screen change luminance, its really annoying. Is this a Disney problem? The constant change in brightness per scene is driving me insane.In my tv disney plus isnt really opening...im stuck at the blue screen with \"Disney+\" in the middle// used with amazon fire TV Stick....any advise?Lots of kids stuff is only showing up in Adult profiles - for example Cars 3 won’t show up in Kids profile, only Adult ones. I can’t understand why as there’s plenty of other PG stuff included with Kids!I can’t get subtitles at all, UK, using PS4 app, mobile app and browser (Chrome). Any article I’ve found says to use accessibility settings, but they don’t turn up for me. Any help?In the UK and watching on browser. I\\'ve found that even with autoplay on, it will do 2 episodes (the one played then one autoplayed) then not autoplay a 3rd episode. Anyone else having this issue?Has there been any fix identified for the issue a lot of us are having with the app not loading on Fire Stick? I already tried deleting the app, restarting the stick and installing it again. This does nothing.I can\\'t find the \\'Send Feedback\\' button. I googled it and I was told that it\\'s one of the four big buttons when you go on the help section but it\\'s not there.PS4 subtitles settings?Disney+ just came out yesterday in my country, and I\\'m dealing with the awful black boxes subtitles on PS4. Guides online say I can customize them from the Accessibility settings, but I can\\'t find them anywhere. I managed to customize them from my PC but it didn\\'t carry over to my PS4. Is the Accessibility option not showing up just a bug?I use a Fire TV Stick 4K with an old LG Smart TV from 2014 (4K + HDCP 2.2  but no HDR) but the resolution seems to be capped at 1280 x 720 (according to the developer options). Also only the HD icon is displayed and not the 4K one. I tested the stick on a newer LG Smart TV and there the 4K Icon is displayed (however still a max resolution of 720p according to the developer options). Any ideas?I\\'m from Germany and I have a Fire TV Stick 4K. So I installed Disney+ without any problems, but when I want to watch a movie, all I can see is, that the movie only has HD Quality instead of 4K Ultra HD. Netflix and Prime Video are working with Ultra HD. Does anybody have the same problem?How do u get the app on a now tv box??? (UK)US- I have a hisense TV with the Disney plus app and all of a sudden last night whenever I clicked on a show or movie it would just get stuck loading and either my TV would turn off because it took too long or sometimes the app crashed. I can select a movie or show on the home screen but I can’t watch them or resume anything I was watching. I’ve tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app,it needed to be updated twice? But it didn’t change anything. This is really frustrating, can anyone help?Edit: Forgot to mention that it works fine on my phone.Keeps saying no Internet connection whenever I try to play content on PS4, tried insalling and reinstalling, no avail.Is it possible to gift a membership in the UK?&#x200B;I want to buy a friend a subscription but obviously want it to be tied to their email and somewhat of a surprise.Watching on iPhone(s) in Switzerland and the visual language (for example the opening credits in Star Wars) are French (Star wars) or Italian (Lion King).

I noticed when I changed that Disney+ stopped showing the bar so Chrome must have done something to take system settings and override Disney+.  I don\\'t think it did that before. I deleted the app, canceled the service, and it wants to just constantly update it into a file taking up space on my PS4.  I did a Google search on this and couldn\\'t really find much on it. I figured I would come here and ask. If anything, I\\'ll get leaped on for not searching harder but I can\\'t figure it out.

My Disney + works on my other tv and on my iPhone. My TV is also up to date with software.Anyone else experiencing this with their LG tv all of the sudden?Thank you so much.Stupid question.  Watching Kronk\\'s New Groove (on Roku if it matters) and the language is English, but a bunch of the in-movie text is in French.  Is this a settings issue?Are they limiting video quality in the US? I\\'m new to Disney+ and just tried watching The Lion King. On my LG B7, which can support 4k and HDR, using the native app there is HDR but the image is rather blurry and looks like 720p or possibly lower. My PC shows about the same quality minus the HDR.

I had made the plan to share my Disney + account with 4 other peeps. So we gathered money and bought the subscription together. But, it simply doesn\\'t work since the start. The only one who was able to log in and use the portfolio of Disney +, had been me. The others couldn\\'t log in and always had been re-directed to register and subscribe for a test subscription, even if they had already a active sub. How is that possible, if I gave them the correct data to log in?May friends payed me their parts of the sum and it feels bad to be the only one, who is able to use it. Any advices or ideas? I\\'m from Germany, by the way and bought the special pre-order offer which goes by 59,99€ for a year.I can\\'t login. I never changed my email or password on it, yet when I try logging in now with the same email and password I\\'ve always been using, it says I\\'m using the incorrect password.My wife and I have been having trouble using Disney+ on our Sony Smart TV (Android OS) for the last 2 weeks or so. All other apps work fine. The menus will not load any movies/shows to display. We can only see the side bar that shows the different csteglries (movies, shows etc). I have tried software updates for the tv (non available), uninstalling the app and reinstalling, resetting my router and modem as well as resetting the television. Nothing has helped, any insight?1. Is there a way to have subtitles constantly on? At the moment, I’m having to put them on for every single episode/film I watch.2. Why is there no remove devices option? Someone’s already shared my password and instead of just removing that one device and changing my password, I’ve had to go onto the online chat, and get everyone kicked off and change my password. Seems like a lot of effort to remove one personDisney+ just launched in Switzerland, and we made 4 Profiles.Is it normal that under \"Continue Watching\" we see the Videos played from another profile?So for example, i haven\\'t watched The Mandalorian on my Profile (A), but on the second Profile (B), Episode 1 and 2 were watched.If i go back to my Profile (A), i see under the Continue Watching that Episode 2 was last played with 2 minutes remaining.Is this a bug or is it supposed to be like that? Cause if it is, it\\'s kinda useless, especially if you have someone with a very active profile and it messes up your reminders!Thank you for your help :)Any Updates on the well known ps4 glitches?

I have managed to change it but had to create a new email address. After doing this I have searched extensively for a way to view what my account is also signed in on remove the device. However, after searching I find that there is no way to do this and better yet, I have also read online that changing the password to your account doesn\\'t log you out of all accounts?! If this is true then I am really disappointed with this as it won\\'t log the other person out so they are able to just change the email again? It\\'s mad.

I have the app installed on my PS4. For some reason when I try to open it while connected to my WiFi I get a \"Sorry, something went wrong. Please try again later\" message before even getting to the log-in screen and have done since release day here in the UK. However, if I hotspot my PS4 with my phones data the app opens and plays perfectly. Also, my WiFi has no issues opening and playing Netflix, Prime, Now TV, etc. I\\'ve tested connection speeds and my WiFi has faster connection than my phones data, 32.0mpbs vs 28.0mbps. It also has full 5 bar connection to the PS4. So far I have tried: rebooting the modem, deleting and reinstalling the app, checked for updates on the PS4 and the app and restarted console. Nothing has worked. Disney live chat got me to reboot the modem and after that didn\\'t work they told me to speak to my internet provider, my internet provider just told me to connect an ethernet cable from the modem to the console but my console and TV are in a different room and I don\\'t want a cable going through my entire place... and honestly don\\'t think I should have to physically connect it if the signal is already full strength and a fast speed?

I get Dolby Vision HDR but not 4K though the TV app. I can get 4K through the app on my XboxOne S, but that only supports HDR10 so I have to choose between Dolby Vision or 4K.

They\\'re all ony 5.1.I opened yesterday a post about the cap on browsers. Every single browser (even Edge, the old and new one) are caped on 720p. It is pathetyc.I got downvoted because ppl were saying \"it is because the covid situation\", but it is not. It has nothing to do with the epidemic. I really want to change this, but don\\'t know where to report this. We need a native windows 10 app, or a change in the browser restrictions.I use a Windows 10 PC as a HTPC which is linked to a Dolby Digital capable receiver via optical TOSLink.  When I use the Netflix App, I get correctly passed through Dolby Digital  5.1 audio and the receiver pops up \"Dolby D\" to show it\\'s decoding the  stream.  When I use MS Edge browser (it\\'s the only browser with Dolby Digital Plus/Atmos support) to play back any of the test stream files on the Dolby site - the system works perfectly with the receiver popping up \"Dolby D\" and output correctly in 5.1.  When I use MS Edge to playback a video from Disney+ at the moment I only  get a stereo stream passed to the receiver.  Is this a restriction from Disney?Is it related to the aged TV I use as a monitor maybe not being able to do HDCP?Do you get any 5.1 audio from your setup - or is that not something you can check? To watch in 4K via browser, you need I think the same as Netflix.  1. A tv with HDCP2.2 on the HDMI port2. You need to use your Integrated Graphics Card from the 7th gen iGPU (you say you have a i7 9700K, so I think you have a discrete GPU?

But in short: Download the App for iOS or Android. Start a Movie on your TV. Then go into the App and start the Video you started before. Now change the Audio to your desired Language in the phone app. Close the App and restart the Video on your Fire TV Stick or Smart TV App. The Language change is Account bound so it will Transfer to any Device.Your Xbox always Outputs Atmos, and the default setting has the xbox doing it\\'s own Atmos Upmix. You can turn that off in the Dolby Access app.Disney+ is currently not actually providing any Atmos Sound, even on titles that have Atmos sound. Apparently this is to save Bandwidth during the Corona Crisis, though that makes bo sense, since DD+ Atmos adds almost no additional Bitrate compared to 5.1 Audio.Do you see a side menu on the left side of your App? If not, welcome to the Club. I cannot change profiles either or acess my watchlist.Same problem. It is mentioned on the webos subreddit but no answer yet :(Call support answer the verification info like country and billing info. If it\\'s a monthly they\\'ll have you create a new account and grant there. If yearly they still have you create a new account and do a swap that takes a couple of days to get done.Same issue with Amazon FireTV stick, but I have 2.0 audio also thru Chromecast. Can\\'t get any AC3 stream out of it.EDIT: my bad. It works thru Chromecast via Android Smartphone. Still no 5.1 on the same TV / receiver thru the FireTV stick. The same stick works fine on Dolby with Netflix and Prime Video.>You can switch the the US version of the Help Center using the drop down at the bottom of the page. There you will find the feedback button.I\\'m having the same problem. No 4K, only HD. Very dissapointing :(I think it\\'s an issue with firesticks/boxes.The DisneyPlus app should be available for all Android devices with Android OS 5.0 (Lollipop) and later (*according to their Help Center*). I\\'d recommend you to contact Customer Support for a detailed answer or perhaps a solution via [https://help.disneyplus.com/csp](https://help.disneyplus.com/csp).A user on our Discord had the same problem, we directed them to Customer Support. It turned out that (*quote*) \"`they appear to have very sensitive security settings and my IP was blocked by D+`\". So I recommend you to do the same. Contact Customer Support via  [https://help.disneyplus.com/csp](https://help.disneyplus.com/csp).Brilliant. That helped. Plus clearing the browser cache. Thanks for help.Same issue here. It is mentioned on the webos subreddit but no answer yet :(On which device/browser?Same here.  Can\\'t tell if it\\'s a regional or global issue.  Was hoping to see this board \"blowing up\" about this issue.FYI.  Had to reset the PWD and it works fine now.I had to reset password for some reason today too. Never logged out before and no changes in passwordSame here reset password but it\\'s really weirdThat was the case for me for the past week. I just tried and i am able to login, but now all my profiles are gone. But i can see them on my Roku. Big Clusterfuck.Same problem. It is mentioned on the webos subreddit but no answer yet :(I honestly got NO issue at all on my Samsung TV. Maybe you can look up on RTings for some setting-improvements? Whats your TV?I\\'m not sure, there is a „livestream“ on Disney+…When you\\'re in Europe, it\\'s due to the corona-virus pandemic. Look on their help-page.What production year is your SamsungTV?Where are you from?Here\\'s a list of all supported devices:  [https://help.disneyplus.com/csp?id=csp\\\\_article\\\\_content&sys\\\\_kb\\\\_id=d2b91d6bdb3048900a2af56e0f96197f](https://help.disneyplus.com/csp?id=csp_article_content&sys_kb_id=d2b91d6bdb3048900a2af56e0f96197f)The quality is reduced during corona crisis. Otherwise the internet will be overloadedYup via cable with between 45-50mbps up and down. Netflix, Amazon, Plex etc do not have any issues streaming and I’ve only encountered it on Disney+ app on PS4. It doesn’t happen on iOS app or browser. So can only assume it’s an issue with the PS4 app specifically. Looks like I’m not the only one who’s had this issue with the PS4 app tho from what I’ve searched.Eugh that sounds horrible. I’ve had the “no connection” error too (even though everything was still connected too). Had to close the app and restart it for it to work again despite the message on the screen saying it would auto start again upon “supposed” reconnection. Been watching Clone Wars today and it happens every episode, at least once. I really hope they get this fixed. I mean I can understand if this was due to the load on their end cause of the Europe launch... but the fact it was reported months ago by US peeps and still happens is worrisome.Bizarre why a 4K firebox wouldn\\'t have itYeah my TV works. Fire and PS4 doesn\\'tYeah, I’m on an LG also.  Just started noticing it last night.Wow really it’s been like this since November? That’s terrible to be honest. Disney need to fix it urgently otherwise a lot of people will lose their accounts.Wow that’s really annoying, if I remove one will one which I previously added be added back at the bottom??Call disney plus CS or my ISP?Edit: Just got off Disney Plus live chat they said there\\'s nothing wrong with my IP. It\\'s being escalated to the next level but that could take up to a week before i get an email.yep, i can confirmI\\'m going to try to get through to a 2nd line tech and see if I can work on this with them.I don\\'t mind if it\\'s an app or if it\\'s just to allow browsers to access higher video and audio streams. I suspect that they could alter a few configs on the web server and allow Edge to access higher resolution video and higher quality audio.I\\'ll try to keep this updated if I get anywhere with it.Idk about the audio, I only looked for the video qualityI have an old GPU: GTX 970Aber warum können sie das nicht? YT \"kann\" auch weiterhin 4kI\\'m not tech savvy in the least bit so apologies if this is a dumb question but, can I use a Roku device on my Toshiba FireTV?If you have IPv6 enabled, that caused my LG Smart TV to not work. Set it to IPv4 (or just disable IPv6) and try again.Thanks for the reply.  Today I chatted with Disney+ Support and as a result during the chat I called my Internet provider.  Looks like Disney+ and the partner company is using an outdated database for IP address & location checking. They have only records for the biggest ISPs in Austria and the newer entrys from the smaller ISPs with their address pools are not listed. Thats why I can\\'t connect from my home network but it\\'s working from mobile phone (mobile network from biggest provider). Till the problem is solved all users from such ISPs will get the notification that the service is not available in their region, because the system can\\'t find the ip address in the database to check location...  Currently Disney+ and the smaller austrian ISPs are working on a fix but looks like that will take several days.   So guess I have to watch Netflix in that time. ;-)How do I find that out?I\\'m having the same issue. 3.3.4-4217 (dreadlocks-dharug)Nope, doesn\\'t work for me. And as mentioned before, support is completely clueless, they kept repeating basic things and didn\\'t answer my specific questions.That’s kinda ridiculous. Especially given how popular the FireTV is outside of the states.Haven\\'t they turned off 4k stream during Corona Virus for bandwidth purposes?It seems to be a little better yesterday but seems to crash with 4k content mostly, think they may be pushing too much of the stream through and it’s crashing the app. HD seems to work fine!Glad I\\'m not alone on this. Are you also based in the EU? Or US? I thought perhaps it\\'s an early bug and the EU app has a different code basis than what is already out in the US. Otherwise, why has no-one else noticed that in North America yet?Oh ok, thanks for your reply. So even though within the Disney+ App (on the Xbox) it is showing the Atmos logo, it is still not providing atoms sound? That seems a bit misleading.No, I do not see anything but the Disney sign on the left sideYupIt\\'s all very random.I know a guy that on a Sony TV (Android TV) gets stereo but here on reddit another guy with a similar Android TV gets 5.1Thanks, I\\'ll tryThank you! I\\'ll try this.PC, windows 10, edgeIt\\'s definitely not the TV, it\\'s pro calibrated and other content (Netflix etc) is fine. It\\'s just the Disney content/app.That’s what I assumed, but I could not find it on the Dutch help page...I’ve checked official tech support and the model and it turns out it’s pre 2016. Bummer (well at least we have been planning on getting those new fancy TVs that resemble a picture frame)Having this exact issue as I type this. You ain\\'t alone.Me too... it’s very frustrating. Up to a 10 second pause for it to register a button press.I think they did this to prevent account sharingI\\'m pretty sure if you remove one you will have to physically add another one.Same here. Works on my windows desktop, but not on my android devices. Works on mobile data though, not through wifiThanks a lot! I am desperated trying to find ways to fix this, but is impossible. Paying the Disney Plus service and having a top 720p quality is super frustrating.I also tried to port the Xbox app to windows 10. There were some reports that it worked perfectly, and it would fix the quality issue for sure. But after those reports in some webs, they did the Xbox app only as \".emsix\" ( Xbox only installer) instead of \"msix\" (Xbox and w10 installer). So they even changed  it on purpose, so we could not get the app even if it is ported. No comments...Thanks for the feedback.So you need to use the iGPU of your cpu, the Intel UHD 630. Plug the HDMI cable in the mobo hdmi port.Don\\'t even try using your 970, it will not work.Sie könnten, die EU hat sie aber darum gebeten, dass Internet „frei“ zu halten, für wichtigeren Datenverkehr. Netflix & Amazon Prime machen da z.B. auch mit. YouTube sogar auch, allerdings ist die Komprimierung bei YouTube an sich schon total beschissen, sodass du das 4K, was du dort gucken kannst, eh kein richtiges ist. Die Komprimierungen von Disney+, Netflix und Co. sind eben besser aber dadurch datenhungriger.Yes definitely. Just plug in a roku into one of the hdmi ports on your tv, switch to that input and go from there.I don\\'t see the option to adjust this on my fire stick. It used to work till last week. All other apps work just fineSettings > General > About This TVI have 4k available on the LG TV app but it’s too unreliable to useI\\'m in the UK. Guessing you are too?Yeah, had a look online last night and couldn\\'t see anyone else with the issue.It sucks, but I\\'m glad it\\'s not just me.Right now that would be the case. Turn off the Xbox Upmixing and check whether you actually get sound from above then...if you are in Europe, then probably not...Then you got the same Problem as me. I too see nothing else than the Logo. At the Fire TV Stick of my Girlfriend its working properly. There was an update today, couldnt check mine at home yet.I even tried to spoof the EDID of the receiver, to make sure it was advertising 5.1/DD capabilities. When I spoof 2 LPCM channels, Chromecast correctly reverts to stereo audio, no change for FireTV Stick with Disney+. When I spoof 5.1/DD, Chromecast has 5.1 audio, still no change for FireTV Stick with Disney+: just 2 channels. I read somone had luck with the FireTV 4K version. I agree it seems very random.This was it! They had to unblock my IP.Same problem with Chromium, try Chrome or Firefox! :]Very strange…but nevertheless, I would check the settings for myself WHILE HDR is enabled and even when it\\'s disabled.This is what they write in German:>**HINWEIS:**  Angesichts der von den Regierungsbehörden ausgesprochenen Bedenken  hinsichtlich der Nutzung von Breitbanddiensten in dieser angespannten  Zeit haben wir Maßnahmen ergriffen, um die Bandbreiten-Nutzung zu  verringern, wodurch unter Umständen Streaming-Inhalte in HD- und  UHD-Formaten nur eingeschränkt oder gar nicht verfügbar sein werden. Wir  bedanken uns für deine Geduld und dein Verständnis.Yeah, then it\\'s impossible to get the app.Nice! Make sure to look out for OLED Displays. The picture-quality is absurdly good.How does it prevent thatThat’s dumb, I can’t remember everything I have added!I\\'m surprised that they still haven\\'t changed that yet.Naja aber FHD@60fps sitzt drin finde ich 😂Ok thats what I thought just wasnt positive. Thanks!!3.3.4-3718 (dreadlocks-dharug)Germany here. Perhaps indeed related to the bandwidth cut down? Are you using a 2017 OLED from LG? Or a later modelOk, will do, thanks for your help. But in general (when not coincidentally having a huge pandemic wrecking the world) Disney+ on the XBOX One does support Atmos? (Is there any info regarding the languages in which Disney+ supplies Atmos? Is it only the English soundtrack, or also others?)Again, thanks for your reply!how long did it take to get your IP unblocked? I am having similar issues and have contacted the disney plus team and now waiting for the escalation team to pick this upThanks I’ll see if it worksWould you share your username and pwd if the people can change it and you can\\'t go back in?I wouldn\\'t, unless they are close friends.Wie gesagt, ich habe die Erfahrungen nicht gemacht mit unter HD und 60fps. Was für ein Setup hast du? Fernseher, PS4,…?It\\'s a C7, so I think that is 2017.If the Xbox shows Atmos next to the title, then I assume the Xbox app for Disney+ can actually support Atmos. No guarantees of course...But assuming that to be the case then, once the Pandemic passes and the bandwidth restrictions are dropped, Atmos should be available for the english version of many titles, including Marvel and Star Wars content.Does it?Yeah but the fact is that there’s no email authentication so there’s no security if someone illicitly gets your details. They can then change change all the detailsLinux/Chrome, da kann man ja leider auch nichts downloaden...Wenn ich die Sachen auf meinem Android downloade bekomme ich fhd@60, aber wer guckt schon gerne auf dem Handy...Yes, 2017 model. I hope this is not an inherent bug to the 2017 LG oled series. Otherwise we might get left on the side of the road. I doubt there will be any more bug fixes or firmware updates for the older models.Hast du schon einen anderen Browser probiert?Selbstverständlich, Firefox genau das selbe und Chromium geht grundsätzlich garnichtOkay, dann endet mein Verständnis ab hier. Auf meinem MacBook und Firefox läuft es flüssig.Es hieß ja erst dass Disney+ Linux aussperrt, aber eigentlich haben sie das ja angepasst…It’s my understanding that Endgame is Disney’s longest film in general, but there may be an acquisition title on the platform somewhere that’s longer. May depend on your country.Not the winner, but quite up there is The Sound of Music at 2 hours 55 minutes.The uncut version of Bedknobs and Broomsticks may not be as long as Avatar or Endgame but it FEELS as long.I don’t know what it is right now, but I wouldn’t be surprised if one of their upcoming Originals, A Celebration of the Music of Coco, becomes one of the longest (if not the longest) when it comes out because it’s the entire Coco movie (105 minutes) plus a full concert, assuming it’s the entire Bowl event without any cuts, so I’m imagining it’ll be at least 3 hours long.Like others have said, right now it’s probably Endgame because that’s 3 hours 3 minutes long and I personally can only think of two movies that long, Endgame and The Irishman (the latter is on Netflix).Avatar? Is that longer than Endgame?Pollyanna is shorter than Endgame but it’s still pretty longOnce upon a time in America. I think it\\'s over 4 hours. Great movie though!Try Gone with the Wind. Good Lord, it\\'s a freakin\\' marathon of a movie. Run time 3 hrs 58 min. We\\'ll, I guess it\\'s not in Disney+, but still...It’s Avengers: EndgameI think sound of music might be longer.Edit: nvm not longerAvatar is another famously long movie, but it\\'s about 20 minutes shorter than End Game, which is listed as 3hr 3 mins, including credits.There\\'s technically \"Arendelle Castle Yule Log\" that lasts 3hr 1 min and has no credits. Not a movie, but still... it\\'s all I know that\\'s longer than End Game (if we\\'re not including credits)!Three longest films are Endgame, Sound of Music, and Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds EndI was going to say Sound of Music but that is just shy of 3 hours at 2h55m.  I think Endgame probably takes it.So based on Letterboxd which allows you to sort by service if you have pro access it is in fact Endgame (3hr 3m). The next films (not counting the 3 hr Arendelle yule log) are Sound of Music (2hr 55 min), Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End (2hr  49min), Avatar (2hr 44min), and rounding up the top 5 is Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2hr 32 min). Of interest (maybe) longest Disney cannon animated film is Fantasia (2hr 6 min) and longest Pixar is Cars 2 (1hr 57 min).Edit: Endgame official time from Disney+ addedNot sure if Bi Centennial Man is on there, it should be. But that\\'s like 3.5 hoursI love Bedknobs and Broomsticks but it is so slowly paced that it feels like it is about 4 hours long.[deleted]A runner up is Pirates of the Caribbean: At World\\'s End.  2 hrs and 48 minutes.Pirates of the Caribbean 3 is 2hrs 49minWhat is the point of this question?I mean, maybe. The closest I can find is The Sound of Music, which is 8 minutes shorter.Actully the uncut version of the happiest millonare is, but it or its cut veraion are not on Disney+ for unknown reasonsEndgame is 3 hrs 1 minuteI literally just commented that to someone else. Lol. But yeah, it doesn\\'t look like there\\'s one longer than them.Right?! I was surprised to find out it’s only 2 hours. I swear it was longer when I was a kid...I haven\\'t seen that movie, but it seems interesting from the description. Gonna add it to my list.I don’t think there is an uncut version of it. My understanding the musical numbers that were cut don’t exist in any form, or were possibly just rehearsed and never filmed.Lord of the rings return of the king is 3.35hrs and the extended version is 4.2 hrs lolThe right stuff is 3h 13minNo. Avatar is 2 hours and 42 minutes.Someone else commented that, it turns out it\\'s just under 2 hours.Is there anywhere to stream GWTW? What a fantastic film.Well if Disney owns it, then it counts since there\\'s a chance it\\'ll be added to Disney+ down the line.Can we have 1 comment section on the internet without mentioning what\\'s happening in the world right now?I\\'m just genuinely curious. No hate, dude.Yeah I do not know why it is not on there, it was one of Walts Disneys last live action moviesThe longest cut of The Happiest Millionaire isn’t as long as EndgameYeah, I just looked it up and can\\'t find it on there.Worth every minute.  Coulda sat through more.Wow, is the directors cut of Amadeus even that long? And that\\'s the theatrical release of end game?Really? That Movie feels as long as 4 hours!Any Disney film with David Tomlinson is great. Mary Poppins. The Love Bug. Bedknobs and Broomsticks.Damn. Can\\'t believe Endgame is longer. I clearly remember thinking it could have been an hour longerAvatar felt about four hours>  it\\'s just under 2 hours.Lol, what? Its 4 hours 16 mins.Yeah...I don\\'t know where you got that from. It\\'s over 4 hours dude!Not sure if you’re making a Trump joke or not, but it’s on Hulu right nowWarner owns Gone with the Wind, which means it will stream on HBO Max soon.Walt Disney didn’t have anything to do with the production of The Sound of Music, it wasn’t even produced by Disney, it was produced by 20th Century FoxThe middle is pretty bad lmaoThere\\'s only one version of Endgame.The director\\'s cut of Amadeus is exactly 3 hours.Extended editions:* Fellowship of the Ring 3 hours, 28 minutes* The Two Tours 3 hours, 43 minutes* Return of the King  4 hours, 11 minutesThose are the practical ones that come to mind. Here\\'s the [longest films list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_longest_films), but it\\'s a deceptive list. The super long \\'films\\' tend to be TV miniseries\\'.A movie where animated suits of armor fight Nazis!Endgame had faster pacing, so that might be why.Because avatar had that silly has break in the middle. Endgame was such a good story I was invested the whole way.What\\'s crazy is I\\'m still wrong. It\\'s not the longest movie ever. That belongs to a movie called Fanny and Alexander..... At a whopping time of 5 hours and 26 minutes.Whoops. That\\'s another movie I was thinking of. My mistake. But I can\\'t find it on Disney+. Maybe it\\'s not in my region?Why would being enthusiastic about a film be a Trump joke? Genuinely confusedit’s not thoughI have literally never come across this opinion. Why do you say it’s so bad?*gets downvoted for sharing an opinion*classic redditEvery second of it is bad.Haven\\'t they put together one with the deleted scenes yet?i watched the extended fellowship recently as was happy to see that the credits were like 30-40 minutes longI haven\\'t seen the extended editions yet. But I thought they all clocked in at least 4 hours each.Gettysburg is 4 hours, 14 minutes, but it was originally made as a miniseries. Gods and Generals was made for theatrical release and its directors cut is 4 hours, 40 minutes.To this day, that movie is still the longest, but shortest-feeling movie I’ve ever watched.Lol \"good story\" and \"endgame\" are practically criminal to put together.[“The winner is … a movie from South Korea! What the hell was that all about? We got enough problems with South Korea with trade,” he said of a close U.S. ally. “Can we get ‘Gone With the Wind’ back, please?”](https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2020/02/21/trump-gone-with-the-wind-historians/)It just drags the movie down. The CGI isn\\'t as good as it is toward the end of film, the humor is pretty bad, and the whole act just seems like egregious fan service without really serving the plot. I know this opinion isn\\'t in the majority so maybe I\\'m wrong, but idk. The whole fat Thor/depression stuff I felt was horribly executed and they could have cut all of Asgard and like half of 2012 Avengers from the movie and saved 20 minutes. I remember the earlier movies. I don\\'t need them to actively be like \"Hey remember these things? We do! Isn\\'t that cool?\"The deleted scenes that they have released wouldn\\'t really fit into the movie properly which is likely why they haven\\'t done that.Right ! Honestly doesn’t feel like 3 hours.. I watch it and still want moreThe Green Mile felt way shorter than the 3+ hours it wasOh...racismI wouldn’t necessarily say you’re wrong by any means. I think I’m able to overlook those things quite a bit more, but I really appreciate your explanation, because I was genuinely curious. I think those are all very fair reasons to not care for those parts of the movieI thought Fat Thor was realistically visually portrayed, and loved that they didn\\'t magically remove the fat after making their point that he\\'d been depressed.Ngl wasn\\'t expecting to see you have an actual explanation of why you disliked the middle. Was expecting some bs or troll trying to get a bunch of dislikes. I really enjoyed all of the movie but I see what you mean. Sucks you\\'re getting downvoted  just for sharing your opinionDefinitely still really liked the movie overall, especially the first time I saw it. But on repeat viewings I always go get a snack or go to the bathroom during the Asgard scenes. To each their own.Happened to me tooCan you change playback on the PS4 from 60fps to 50 fps?Happened to me as well!PS4. I feel like this used to happen with Netflix for me a while ago.I\\'ve noticed studded like you describe today, I\\'m blaming the servers being over worked 😂Just wanted to add that I was experiencing this too,only on PS4...happens occasionally and very subtle, was sometimes unsure if it really happened :) my workaround was to use the Chromecast and cast it, never noticed once while casting.   I just put it down to the PS4 app.Happens to me on the PC.I have a PS4 and the same thing is happening for me. It was worse on the first couple days (Was only released in the UK on Tuesday) but it still happens occasionally. I’m assuming it’s just too many people using it and it’s slowing it down.I have freezes for about 2 seconds every 15 Minutes on my Sony Bravia Android TV. On my fire tv stick I have zero problems.This still happens to me frequently on the PS4 appPS4. Have had D+ stall picture with audio continuing. After about 20 seconds both audio and video return to the moment it froze and it begins playing normally. Can sometimes happen once a day, sometimes a dozen times in 20 minutes. Since day 1.what platform?I\\'ve been watching with my PS4.I\\'m currently using my WebOS app on my TV to see if it\\'s a better experience.I haven\\'t experienced these type of momentary(I repeat milliseconds, you would miss it if you blinked long enough or looked away) on any other streaming platform or using any other hardware.I currently use PS4, WebOS, and Chromecast to stream.But I prefer PS4 because it\\'s faster hardware than Chromecast and my TV which uses WebOS. I can use my TV\\'s remote with my PS4 to control and navigate ever UI, just like WebOS or over air channels, but I can only control Chromecast streams with my phone which isn\\'t always fast or convenient.Also, Disney Plus is the only streaming app on my PS4 where the back button on my TV remote can\\'t go back to the main screen after selecting content. I have to always use my PS4 controller.what platform can you change the framerate?I\\'ve literally never seen that option on any streaming app.I didn\\'t know that was an option.let me check and I\\'ll get back to you.But these freezes happen so sporadically and randomly that I\\'m not even sure how one I would have to watch content to know if that worked.If it happens once every 10 minutes lasting literally 200-300ms it would be hard for me to know if it stopped freezing or if I\\'m constantly missing it because I\\'m using! phone.Also this isn\\'t a huge deal. Definitely not a deal breaker. It\\'s not constantly stuttering. Just freezing for an extremely short amount of time ever so often. I\\'m just more concerned if it\\'s a service wide problem or just limited PS4s, or even just my PS4, and phones, Chromecast and WebOS aren\\'t affected. :/Thanks for responding back. I was wondering this.Resuming playback also seems to be unresponsive.Like if it\\'s paused pressing play doesn\\'t resume play. The play and pause icons change but that\\'s it. I had to rewind to a previous timestamp for it to resume.So maybe it\\'s just PS4.you make a good point. Coronavirus and self-distancing and isolation could certainly be one reason.Also, Disney Plus on WebOS is trash. It\\'s so slow.So Ps4 is the way to go for me.Also how is resuming playback for you and what platform are you using?It literally won\\'t resume play on PS4 at times unless I also rewind 5 seconds.I have a firestick plugged into my LG C9, I\\'ve noticed sometimes Disney+ would glitch out the video with a white aritifact, is that what you mean? Maybe it\\'s changing the resolution or adjusting the video.Fire Stick 4k. Its not a Disney Plus option specifically, its an option for all content on the fire stick.With the playstation i can understand if you might not want to do it if it affects the rest of your games.I\\'m using WebOs and find it smooth, which is wierd compared to your experience. I find it takes about 10 to 20 secs to start a video but pause and play is no issue. Works as intended.no. literally just stops playback and then resumes.But it happens so fast, over the course of milliseconds, that depending on if you\\'re even watching the stream, or there\\'s a scene transition you might honestly not notice or realize something wrong happened.Playback isn\\'t really an issue. I have really fast internet, fiber. So ever video plays at fullest resolution.It never buffers so If the video starts in SD or something I just have to rewind and it\\'s clear for the duration.This applies for everything. Crunchyroll, Netflix, Hulu, Disney+.But that very slight freeze that happens. I\\'ve have never experienced it.So I\\'m not really even coming on Reddit to complain. Just to find out whether my situation is isolated, because it\\'s my internet lag or even PS4 hardware.Or if there\\'s a possible solution. Or if Disney is even aware of it.WhyOnly Disney could get away with this haha. Never seen anyone with a Netflix or Hulu shirt.I can never bring myself to wear stuff like this. I feel like a walking billboard. And I hate billboards.For when you want to pay to be a walking advertisementSorry to hear you tested positive for Disney.Paying Disney for the privilege of advertising for themIf you bought it and knowing Disney parks I\\'m sure you did. Why did you buy a generic streaming service shirt vs something like a cool epcot shirt?I got it too! Have not brought myself to wear it out I would feel like I got hired as a promoter for Disney+That would honestly be a cool shirt to haveAwesome!  I got mine at Disneyland in January!#WOW THAT’S AWESOME EPICGreat jobPlease tell me it was free[deleted]Why are you bragging about that shirt?  There\\'s literally nothing special about that shirt.You.. you actually bought this?  Why?  We saw them and figured it came with a month or Disney Plus or something.  We were wrong, so we didn’t buy it.XL, please...#HEY! YOU WEEABOOS LIKE CAPITALISM?!?!I said the same thing when I saw them at World of Disney.[deleted]okokWell damn now you gave them both an idea.You obviously don’t live in LA.I used to see tons of people with the old netflix logo shirt, must’ve faded into obscurity.Call me crazy, but... I wouldn\\'t mind owning a Netflix shirtReminds me of the moviepass shirts and merch they starting selling near the endEh, I have a number of shirts with different logos on them. Sometimes it’s fun to just show that you’re a fan of something.Are all of your clothes plain without any logos or insignias?I got a Disney+ hat for free from D23. I only wear that cause it was free, and even then usually just to Disneyland. Also because I’m in California, seeing someone wearing the logo of some streaming service/media company isn’t that odd.[deleted]I do trade shows and know a lot of marketing people for big name companies because of this. Years ago, my company and another company worked together for several things, and because of this I still get new t-shirts (for free) from this other company every year. Some of them have cool designs and I enjoy wearing them, but I also know I\\'m a walking billboard doing so. I\\'m also not a big fan of this company\\'s products (in fact, everything we have from them actually broke by now).Anyway, there\\'s a maker space where I live that I go to for working on projects. I was often doing a lot of projects there compared to other people so I was there a lot. I would wear these shirts there often because they were good work shirts (100% heavy duty cotton black shirt). Someone told me that they purchased a bunch of products from this company because they always saw me wearing those shirts.I now only wear those shirts at home.At the time I was telling all my friends and family that disneyplus was the wave and plus I liked it more and plus it just came outAwesome also went there in December and saw it too!Very coolNah it was like 30 dollars but it was worth itSorry thought it was a cool thing to shareThere’s nothing special about being a dick either, but here you are.I didn’t mean to brag , I just wanted to shareMy parents bought it and I happened to see It and I liked itI’ve only seen one person wear it out in the wild. Immediately thought, they had better have gotten it for free instead of paying like $26...Or OP likes things.Hey now that’s the tourist trap sideI\\'ve absolutely seen a few Netflix shirts. Probably started seeing them in the past couple years.You can be a fan of a product. You can\\'t be a fan of a corporation. That\\'s just embarrassing.No, but I definitely have a preference for clothes without logos. I have a t-shirt repping a local charity and some old clothes from sports I played, but I don\\'t think those really count. I suppose you could call me out for wearing college attire, especially from schools I didn\\'t attend.Pretty much. My original response to this comment was apparently so strongly worded that the automoderator removed it. Something being a corporate something something.Yikes[deleted]Thanks for sharing! I enjoyed it.Ignore the haters. You’re allows for shareThe launch team that works for Disney Streaming Services has similar shirts, but on the back it says \"Launch Team 11/12/2019\".  Next time you see one, try to check the back.* Caveat: I do not speak on behalf of the Walt Disney Companykeeeep hereeeWhy’s that?What are sports teams lol. They\\'re corporations with better public relationsA corporation is just a group of people, don’t be so edgyBut this shirt is a product logo?Oh thought because you know how Were all bored I just saw it and wondered if this sub would like itDo you work for DSS?Yes, that is why I add that caveat at the end of the post, because I\\'ve gotten in trouble before for violation of social media policies.  * Caveat: I do not speak on behalf of the Walt Disney CompanyI\\'ve always been careful about associating any of my personal social accounts with Disney, good call on your part. I\\'ve got this throwaway though, I figured I would pop on the subreddit and see what people were posting about and maybe see if I could help with small stuff!I didn\\'t get a launch team shirt :( I guess they ran out on launch day, because a week later I ended up with a \"DisneyTech\" shirt that doesn\\'t mention D+ :( I got to sign the banner and the Disney+ hat though!.17Not likely at all. Keep in mind, well known cartoons like American Dragon, Aladdin and Lloyd in Space aren\\'t on either.But not in Europe, because of course not!Coco.Homeward Bound.I cry to Moana but 🤷. Inside Out. Toy Story 3, towards the end. Omfg bridge to terabitha should be on there somewhere. That movie. Jesus Christ.Turner and Hooch. I can never watch that movie again.No mention of Up?  A coworker watched it for the first time yesterday and was crying.Revenge of the sith. All of itdefinitely Coco or Bridge To Terabithia. But also probably The Lady And The TrampBridge to TerabithiaEpisode 4 of The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh.Thanks for the recommendations, I have COCO on right now!Any Disney Original movie should do really.If you don\\'t cry at the end of *Old Yeller*, there is something really wrong with you.Coco, for sure!I\\'m not crying, you\\'re crying.If your not with me....your my enemyYou were my brother, Anakin! I loved you! I cried just typing that.OP said **cry**, not cringe.🤣🤣Seasons 1 and 2 are available for me in the US. Season 3 ended really recently, I don\\'t think we\\'ll get that for a while :( Where do you live that you don\\'t have S2?Season 2 is available on the U.S. version.What country are you in? Australia has the first two seasonsYou need to watch Before Ever After before watching the series.Only one season in the UK :(I live in Switzerland must be a country thing then :(Hopefully they add the other seasons for us soon.I think Onward is in the US. Would be cool if it did here in the UK too.Hopefully The rise of skywalkerI would really like to see the Marvel Animated Features releases that includes Ultimate Avengers and Planet Hulk.I have self exiled myself from Disney + until Atmos sound has been restored!None of the recent mcu spider man films are on thereOnward is coming on the 3rd April in the US, but we aren’t even getting Frozen 2 until mid-July in the UK, can’t see Onward coming before that.Onward\\'s arrival on Disney+ is in the US only.Lionsgate have distribution on those so it’s unlikely.Distribution is owned by Sony. It would be unlikely to ever appear on Disney+, unless Disney bought back the rights somehowIsn\\'t Frozen 2 because of an ongoing deal with Sky though? I could be wrong.Frozen 2 is on my Disney+ in UK. I had to search it thoughEdit: it\\'s just the trailer. BoooNooo! You got source?Okay I thought it would be that. Thank you though and have a nice dayYeah, it says something about ‘existing agreements’ in the app when you search for it. Not bothered about Frozen 2, but I really wanna see Onward, love me some Pixar.All of Disney\\'s posts about it have specified that it\\'s only in the US. Although it is arriving on digital storefronts in the UK on April 3rdNo problem. Same to you.Eww daily mailDue to the influx of new users, we are using a Technical and Account support thread. This can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/fo6llp/account_and_technical_support_megathread/Do you have an Amazon account? You can download it the app to the Firestick (the Firestick is about £30) or buy a Chromecast.Okay so I play it off amazon prime?Nah. Of the Fire stick. You download the app for FireTV, but it’s still Disney+. If you download the app via the App Store or Google Play Store, you still watch it via Disney+, not Apple TV+ or sth else.Maybe within the app itself or log onto the app itself from a computer and see if you can do it there.Auto renewal, it’ll tell you your next billing date on the account pageAuto renewal. But if you don\\'t want to auto renew, you can cancel your subscription and you will still have access to the service until the last day of your billing cycle.thanks!Didn\\'t think of that. Would be cool watching from headset like YouTube.I don\\'t think so. VR seems dead for mobile devicesI have the same issue. Even if I would watch it all the way through the end of the credits and not touch anything (until the front screen menu re-appears by itself), whatever I’ve watched will still end up in the Continue Watching list.If I click any item in this list, it will show me the +\\\\- last 10 seconds of the video. Then it disappears, only to return later.It is true and seems to be impossible to get rid of it. Definitely a bug.I’ve had this same problem happen. I really think all streaming services should take it off of continue watching once you get to the end credits.Also there is no real indication of watched episodes, for example I\\'m watching the clone wars and since you should watch them out of order, it doesn\\'t mark anything as played making it hard for me to keep track.I tend to find that you have to wait through the credits to the point where the credits minimise and it offers up a suggestion of what to watch next. If you exit as soon as the credits start it sticks around in your continue watching.To the end of the movie or to the end of the credits.? Netflix its to the end of creditsonce the movie ended i skipped till all of the credits were overWhy would you think an 11 year movie would be the pinnacle of audio and video to showcase your new home theatre lolIt’s not even 4k on D+.I have long thought Avatar was overrated. I’m pretty concerned Fox-Disney is making a massive mistake by doing 4 sequels all at once.Yep. I have the BluRay. That movie doesnt age well. A lot of it does look like a pre rendered video game cinematic.Another movie that also doesn\\'t age well is the Fast and Furious with the CG Paul Walker.

Younger ones don’t pick up the adult version quite as quick but it’s not bad.Cheers, done that now.You have a link?To what? I said yes because I agree with you.......... I didn\\'t see that you asked a question lolAh lolI tend to find you have to wait until the credits minimise and it gives you the option to watch the next episode or a suggestion of what to watch next.Third party services like Reelgood or Just Watch are ways to see what is on streaming services without subscribing.Have your parents sign up to the 7 day free trialUnfortunately no, you can call customer service though and have them do a force lock out which kicks everybody off and have you change the passwordYeah, this is a real flaw with Disney+. Plus the 10 devices limit. They should just really copy Netflix when it comes to this so we can see the IP address and have the ability to log out of all devices.Somebody posted here a while back that changing the email address on the account will kick off all users and force a relogin but I haven\\'t tested it.https://support.disney.com/hc/en-gb/articles/115003114683-How-do-I-add-or-remove-devices-I can\\'t wait for Disney to put in a proper account sharing feature.Thank you very much.

Im gonna see if it works and come back to you then :)https://support.disney.com/hc/en-gb/articles/115003114683-How-do-I-add-or-remove-devices-Thanks, it worked. It\\'s kinda unnecessary that you have to do it that way, but at least there is some way to do itDisneyLife is sadly only available for UK users. Can\\'t log in cuz im germanChanging the password doesn\\'t kick anyone out unless she physically logs out of her device and has to re-enter the new password.This DOES NOT work with Disney+It’s about Disney life, a service that has been discontinuedSupposedly it\\'s gonna be between October and December, but it might be before that. There\\'s really no way to really know.I hate to break it to you but falcon and the winter soldier isn\\'t going to be out in August anymoreCheaper by the Dozen 2\"Outrageous Fortune\"Reign of Fire, ArmageddonEd Wood is R rated so won\\'t appear on the service.Titan A.E.Planet of the Apes rebootThe League of Extraordinary Gentlemen Master and Commander The Far Side of the World I, RobotRobotsDr Seuss\\' Horton Hears a Who!Fantastic Mr foxThe Chronicles of Narnia Voyage of the Dawn TreaderGulliver\\'s Travels Life of PiEpicThe Peanuts MovieAnita Battle AngelSpies in DisguiseDick TracyThe RockCon AirThe AbyssX-Men filmsExodus: Gods And KingsSouth PacificNot a bad list but some of those may be better off might be a better fit for Hulu.Well, no one knowsIs anyone sure in these dark times?I would have to assume it won\\'t make its Fall release date.Yeah, I don\\'t even know why these are questions as no one can answer them.When no news, is suddenly news.So like everything else right now. “When will the restaurants reopen? Not really sure”“How about the cinema? Not really sure”“What about the theme park? Not really sure”“And the clothing stores? Not really sure”Even if he did know, he shouldn\\'t say when. Leave that to Disney.Wow premium Disney plus originals are going to be dry this year.You don’t say?*surprised pikachu face*No one is sure of anything these daysMaybe Ja Rule?  Let\\'s get him on the phone and see.I\\'m guessing that it might still make 2020 but WandaVision might be pushed back to 2021.Didn’t it have a weeks worth of filming left?Disney needs to add more fox tv shows then if this is not going to happen To make up for thisI’m working to-gos at my restaurant right now and we’re very limited on what we have due to certain things being hard to obtain so I’ll get people asking for a side we’re out of then at the end asking me, one of two of the bottom rung employees of this restaurant, when we’re going to get it back..... like do you understand what’s happening right now?You sure about that?But wandavision was done filming already right?YeahPlease give us Buffy, Angel and Firefly.They should make up for the Corona virus?Not sure why you’re getting downvoted. With all these releases more than likely getting pushed back for who knows how long, there is nothing to look forward to. Disney needs to add something and I see no problem with adding FOX ShowsThat would be a great idea.Yep. It’s anxiety. People are nervous. I think people ask because they are looking for hope.That was announced but they said that its production was stopped due to the coronavirus. I\\'m assuming it\\'s for reshoots maybe or possibly just extra CGI. I only really think that it\\'ll be pushed back to 2021 because they\\'ll probably want Falcon & the Winter Soldier to premiere first which I can see being delayed by a few months.I never watched these shows so would not mind trying them out But I say modern family and Malcom in the middle will be the first two shows to be added due to how popular they areNo but they will more than likely lose subscriptions because of a lack of new content.Yes, it\\'s Disney, not your local independent restaurantIt helps not to panic watch loads of content straight away. You could pace it out.Basically Joss Whedon\\'s tv shows.So will every other streaming service. Disney plus will be fine.Well Disney plus has also been out for 5 months so not exactly panic watching but more like running out of content. This wasn’t a problem before because of the releases coming up, but with those on hiatus something needs to fill that void ?But other streaming services have way more content and way more original content too The only reason disney+ has less is because it’s only 4 months old This is a great time for them to add more shows when everyone is at home and will want to subscribe to watch said showNo, they\\'re not like every other service. Netflix just dropped 10 episodes worth of Ozark. Award winning series.They can’t just stop working for however long this takes because they’ll be fine in the long run. If they can do something to get more content on Disney Plus, they will.Yeah I know you asked why people are saying that I gave ya an answerYeah, this is absolute bollocks. Falcon and WS was always going to be August at the earliest, so if you’ve already watched everything you wanted to watch, you still have minimum five months left until the new stuff arrived. It’s not Disney’s fault you can’t count.Yes that is true. I was completely okay with waiting til August and those shows are the majority of the reason I pay for it. I’m waiting for those. But now that they are getting pushed back, with no release date even remotely available at the time I don’t think it’s a bad idea for them to introduce FOX shows to fill that voidMaybe after the backlash over the Love Victor and Lizzy Mcguire shows their considering allowing more adult content on the service.When will we get the Dinosaurs TV show?considering /=/ doing.I agree.Those are both on HuluWhy are you missing the point?Not agreeing with your statement isn\\'t \"missing the point\".I\\'ve heard that the limit is 50 but that could be wrongIt only shows the 50 latest items but as soon as you delete something, old items show up againThere is a limit for how many are displayed (I believe it\\'s 50). If you add 51 items, the one that disappears is still on there, and will show up again when you remove an item. So your watchlist is still there, it\\'s just 50 that show up at the same time.Hmm alright. That doesn\\'t make sense for them to limit the watchlist, hopefully they remove that restriction in the near future.All I can say is it isn’t a recent edit. The original scene where the Big Bad Wolf is a stereotype of a Jewish peddler was changed in 1947 to comply with the Hayes code (note that 1947 was also in the shadow on the Holocaust), and that’s the version used in North American ever since and the version on Disney+. The dialogue was also altered. The Jewish peddler visuals is still distributed on home video in Europe (where racial stereotypes are still common in comic strips like Tin-Tin and Asterix), but all versions since Walt’s day use the altered audio.I can\\'t stand censored films or media.I honestly think they should release these media with an unskippable explanation section at the front (did it for example with dvds of old b/w short cartoons). Cutting scenes or whole movies (song of the south/uncle remus\\'wonderland) doesnt fight racism/xenophobia, education does. Media always has to be evaluated in relation to its origin. As i child i never realized racist stereotypes in these media bc they just were no part of my childhood. But recognizing these things can be very educational (e.g. realizing that antisemitism neither was nor is a distinctly \"nazi\" ideology. In fact antisemitism was a really widespread phenomenon during most of western history). Just cutting scenes or movies creates the false illusion that these issues just didn\\'t exist and everything always was fine.[deleted]I think WB did a pretty good job and I think they have found a better solution.https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/3i679m/warner_bros_message_on_prejudice_being_played/These are much more intelligent and fair responses than I expected. Proud of this sub.If you don’t even know what the differences between the cuts why would you come up with ridiculous drivel to somehow excuse the disclaimer?The original has the wolf dress up and act as Jewish caricature. This was made much less explicit in the edit.  [View scene comparison here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC9V9GkoiSg).It was first redone in ‘47 according to [cartoonresearch](https://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/walt-disneys-three-little-pigs-1933/) to allow it to be reissued under the [Hayes Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Production_Code). That first edit replaced the graphics, later edits redubbed the voice of the wolf. Other edits remove the scene.This short is one of the very few that wasn’t released uncensored on the  Walt Disney Treasure’s DVDs. Clock Cleaners is the only other one I can remember, I need to watch the D+ one to see what version is on.As for the disclaimer it is on almost everything older, regardless of potential offending content or clearly whether it is truly presented as originally created.I\\'m not sure why reddit circlejerks over this statement so much. Disney has a statement too but the issue is they still edited itit’s already there, at least for meI\\'m going to assume this is in the US. Two of the movies are on Starz (Dawn of the Dinosaurs, and The Meltdown), so whenever their contract expires. There are two on FreeForm (Ice Age, and Continental Drift), so I would guess those would make their way over soon. One is on FXM (Collision Course), and since that is owned by Hulu/Disney, I would guess that would make it\\'s way over soon. A Mammoth Christmas is on Hulu.DD+ is the usual for shows that aren\\'t atmos.  Or if your system doesn\\'t support atmos you\\'ll get DD+.  Some old(er) content is only stereo, even mono.You can change language but not the format of the audio.  Your device works with the app to handle that in the background.DD+ is the format container that Atmos uses.  Your system will default to DD+ if it doesn\\'t support Atmos.  You will never see TrueHD in any streaming service ever, DD+ was created for streaming services.  You don\\'t need to worry about audio codecs unless you have a home theater setup and need Atmos.but does dd+ require the right setup (receiver and 5.1 surround system) ? and how do i see that there is dd+ running and not normal dd/5.1 ?ok, but dd+ also requires the right setup (receiver and 5.1 surround system), doesnt it?DD+ requires no different setup from DD 5.1.  Your receiver/soundbar would have to tell you what you\\'re gettingyour TV/device can handle itso if a movie supports dolby atmos, but my avr cant handle it, does it automatically switch to DD+ ?If your receiver supports DD+ then, yes, it would just see DD+ as the audio.alright. thanks for the helpIt is due to the Corona-Virus pandemic. Look at their Troubleshooting site.In light of the concerns expressed by government officials regarding the use of broadband services in this challenging time, we have instituted measures to lower bandwidth utilization, and in some circumstances streaming content in HD and UHD formats, including Dolby Atmos audio, will be limited or unavailable. Thank you for your patience and understanding.Once we resume normal operations, this article will be updated with additional trouble shooting tips that can also help you navigate your UHD 4K and Dolby Atmos experience on Disney+ .but it looked like they enabled atmos, because it showing up in the format listing.. it just wasnt playingWhy disable atmos though? This is just a few kbits..In the Details List, they tell you, what the movie/show got for specs. Due to Covid-19, the max we get in Europe this far is HD 5.1.no. 4k is actually available but with a lower bitrate.well then not for me though, or here in Germany. In general a lot of people are saying this and I talked to someone from Disney+ via Chat and they told me: maybe 4K isn\\'t available, which is, what they write on their help-site.Yes, I do think it would be a good time to add ABC and FOX shows.More content is always a good thing IMHO. Of course, I don\\'t think Disney are going to put on 15 or 18 shows, but them using more of their back catalogue would be great to keep subscribers invested.Of course. Once all existing streaming contracts expire, it should be an archive for everything under the Disney umbrella from G/U to PG-13/12. They have no reason to cycle out content nor have any reason not to put appropriate shows on the service.JUST ADD THE MUPPET SHOW ALREADY!  Haha.I\\'d love to see Futurama on Disney+I’d be happy if they’d just add Pepper Ann.It\\'s always a good time to add 20th Century and ABC shows. They should be adding more by now.Yes I’d say do it expand itYes some of the original Fix cartoons would be amazing to have on Disney+yea , some disney shows are missing too like ant farmUp in 🇨🇦 we have Runaways but only season 1. In addition to adding other shows would love if they would add all remaining seasons to the ones they currently have as wellIsn\\'t that what Hulu is for?I was thinking that and they should it makes sense but I don’t think they willDreamworksYesYes. Disney Plus should add shows that meet their criteria of pg-13 and under. They should create a new section for Fox for their shows and movies content. I grew up on shows like How I Met Your Mother and Reba. Having those shows and others on Disney plus would be awesome.I’m surprised they haven’t added the Fosters onto D+ in U.K.  nowhere else to watch it bar *coughs*They should add Young Indiana Jones ChroniclesAnd The Muppet Show.Plus why shouldn\\'t Fox shows like Futurama, Attack of the Killer Tomatoes, Peter Pan and the Pirates be on there?Also shows like The Pirates of Dark WaterOf course.. the biggest issue for me is, that there are no sitcoms.. i wouldnt pay for disney plus again. I get that they worry about the brand name, but there is a huge lack of content and they own the rights to so many family friendly comedy shows.. not everybody is living in NA or is willing to pay for hulu aswell.No, put some of the originals from the Disney Vault on, like we were told would happen when they launched. We want to see Texas John Slaughter, Zorro, Swamp Fox etc. A lot of people who subscribed to Disney for these early shows are getting ready to get rid of the service.I don’t see this happening as long as people stay subscribed. At least not until they are finished rolling the service out globally, and it is stable globally.I want to know why Castle still isn\\'t on the service yet. It was on ABC wasn\\'t it? I used to watch that show every week, but I dropped cable at some point and never got to see how it ended.Definitely fox, like enough to make a new channel!It\\'s always a good time to add 20th Century and ABC shows. They should be adding more by now.15 is there limit as pg 14 is 15 and that is there limit as most 15 films are 12a in uk but 18 no but 15 yes as buffy is a 15But all the 15+ shows will go somewhereAll the music and celebrity rights would likely be a nightmarewakka wakka wakkaWhat about countries without HuluHulu is for R-rated content and ABC is PG-13 and PGWhy you think they won’tThey don’t own DreamWorksYoung Indiana Jones Chronicles is owned by ParamountThere would be a lot of rights issues for The Muppet ShowPirates of Dark Water is owned by WarnermediaYou\\'re wrong https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/fovx78/disney_is_sending_surveys_to_select_subscribers/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=shareEh, probably too \"adult\" since it deals with murders.  Most likely will end up on Hulu.They could have Disney Pixar Marvel Star Wars National geographic Then have Fox So when you click on the fox one it will all be fox movies and showsThat would get another 20m-40m subscribersTotally get it but, it\\'s their property.I just found this on a random site that says they will start rolling out to other countries in 2021. I didn\\'t find a link to their source. Just a statement that claims  the company’s chief executive told investors this in Feb of 2020. [https://thedesk.matthewkeys.net/2020/02/hulu-global-rollout-2021-disney-fox/](https://thedesk.matthewkeys.net/2020/02/hulu-global-rollout-2021-disney-fox/)I would think Hulu will land in the same markets as Disney+, as Disney would rather sell you a bundle.Do they not have an similar services like Stan and Hayu?Because I think there going to take their time with putting content outIt\\'s not on disney plusDisney does own the rights to the live-action DreamWorks Pictures films they released through the Touchstone label from 2011–2016. Those movies include The Help, War Horse, Lincoln, Bridge of Spies, etc. I would love to see some of those films added to Disney+.I thought Pirates of DW was an ABC show.Doesn\\'t Lucasfilm own Indiana Jones?Disney keeps buying studios that give away their brands to othersNowhere does thy state a date that they intend to offer whichever show garners the most support. I stand by my comment.So, you’re wrong.Maybe maybe not. It\\'s not MA so if the surveys go well then stuff like that will find its way eventuallyDon\\'t people commonly get murdered in marvel movies?It wouldn\\'t be a Fox tab since they\\'re trying to remove that word from all of their brands in order to distance themselves from the Fox News Company. It would be a \"20th Century Studios\" tab. And maybe a \"Blue Sky Studios\" tab as well.Exactly! Could you imagine disney buying Sony? For the toby Maguire spiderman?In the ukI have these services Netflix Prime Disney+Do have this one below (I think it’s in the uk I just haven’t subscribed to it)I know there is starzplay I think  I also have a lot of movies on dvd and tv shows on dvdNoBut most of their original shows can’t film due to coronavirus and everyone is at home for a number of months now so it’s good time to release new contentAs they don’t own itYes but I think he was talking about the animated ones which are owned by universalYes, Pirates of Dark Waters aired on ABC, but the show was made by Hanna-Barbera.I think Lucasfilm owns the Indiana Jones character but, The Young Indania Jones Chronicles and the 4 Indiana Jones movies are owned and distributed by Paramount.It\\'s not that these studios gave away their brands, it\\'s just how the deals were originally structured. Besides Lucasfilm only owned a small number of there productions out right, a lot of the films that Lucasfilm made were co-productions with other studios.Prepare to be wrongThe shows are simple yes or no and they have said before that feedback directly impacts Disney+There is 99% chance these will be addedYeah but they don\\'t really have sexy time in them.They don’t even have the mcu Spider-Man movies on Disney+ lolAlso BBC iPlayer amongst other on demand channels that are part of why a TV licence is neededI didn\\'t know that Disney owned fox and abc lolNo. You.There’s about a 100% chance they will be added. I just don’t see it before their rollout is complete and stable.Damn.I thought they had the first one?They have britbox now with itv and I doubt anyone has thatI knew they owned fox but I only found out in last few days that they own abcThe uk Disney+ does not have hulk and the two Spider-Man moviesI have all marvel mcu movies on dvdMaybe for Brits abroad but not many in UK will be using itAaIm in the us, I think spidey 1 is on there, and hulk isn\\'t... so I had to watch it on DVD on a massive screen and it was forgettableThey should buy dreamworksNone of the Spider-Man movies are available in the US unfortunatelyWe don’t even have even Stevens series in the uk Disney+Also will they ever get the Spider-Man mcu movies on Disney+Universal owns Dreamworks so they can\\'t. Plus I don\\'t think Disney would be allowed to buy another animation studio when they own 4 of the major onesReally? I could\\'ve sworn! Maybe it was movies anywhere I saw it onIf they have it here they should have it there... eventuallyNone of the Spider-Man movies are available on Disney+, including the Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield, or Time Holland (MCU). However, if you have the Disney+/Stars package, the MCU Spider-Man movies are available to watch on there, as well as films such as Venom. It’s unlikely that Spider-Man will become available on Disney+ anytime soon, seeing as Sony has been really, really hard about selling the remaining rights to Marvel Studios. This is also why none of the X-Men or the Deadpool movies are available on Disney+. :(Pretty weak line up...They announced Star Wars Resistance season 2 would be coming on March 13th, but it\\'s still not here....Dark Phoenix. Kinda surprised by that one.Night at the museum (I only found the 2nd one on the uk) so would love to watch them again in orderWhat about tv shows any update ok fox and abc shows Also any update on even Stevens series on the uk version as it’s still missingOh, Dark Phoenix? Nice 😯America’s game is weak...Only 5 classic cartoons... when will we get more? We only have 10 now, while other countries have more than 60!Very happy with Man in Space though, about time that we get some of the classic Walt TV shows!What about the other x-men movies?Um, you\\'ve got bigger problems that need to be fixed.  That\\'s not normal at all and it\\'s not a symptom of a bandwidth problem.You might be right, I\\'ve tried so many trouble shooting methods, I thought i had narrowed it down to the bandwidth 😕Do you get this problem with other streaming services?  Have you tried a different HDMI cable?No, only Disney plusWait, are you using a PS4 by chance?Not on the same TV.PS4 are known to work very poorly with Disney+.  So, what device is streaming Disney+ that\\'s having the black out?Oh sorry, Amazon fire stickThey will likely announce Rise of Skywalker for some point in AprilThat\\'s likely because Disney will likely announce Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker to release on April 24. I wouldn\\'t even be surprised to see Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, Spies in Disguise, Mulan, Black Widow, Artemis Fowl and Soul in the coming months.That’s not true. We still have the second half of the final season of The Clone Wars still to come, two new Disneynature documentaries not yet seen and a Coco musical special.Well, April is earth monthYou really don’t know how lucky US Disney+ users are, you guys are getting the better deal BY FAR. Lots of classic content is not made available to European users.Hey April is Earth month and some of us like the NatGeo and Disney Nature stuffThere is basically nothing in uk I think except for originals that already released in usI think they will add The Call of the Wild, The Rise of Skywalker and some other stuff - maybe more of the Blue Sky Studios films.Disney and Apple + the best scam channels ever. Especially Apple +.Artemis Fowl is a total shoe-in. Fans and non fans are united in their disdain it\\'s The Dark Tower 2.0.No way is Mulan or Black Widow skipping theatrical runs. Those two films not getting released in theaters, combined, would likely cost Disney over a billion dollars. There is just no way that make financial sense. You may see smaller budget films skip the theater and go straight to rent or streaming during the pandemic but tent pole films going straight to streaming would be a huge financial misstep. What you will likely see for Black Widow and Mulan is for them to keep getting pushed back until it is safe to release them in theaters.How come European users don’t have many classic content? Is it like with America to where the reason why I hardly have any Fox Studios content is due to FS signing deals with other streaming services that aren’t present in other countries?There will be. They’ve just not announced anything.I’m pretty sure call of the wild has to go to HBO first, I could be mistaken though.It’s not a scam if they tell you exactly what they have, you subscribe, and then realise they were telling the truth.I wish I knew... Disney refuses to give any explanation apart from the tired ‘existing licensing deals’ excuse. Which is nonsense... everybody knows that things like the 1955 Mickey Mouse Club, old TV shows with Walt, obscure ‘60s movies like My Dog the Thief, and the classic shorts are not being streamed or broadcast anywhere else. My guess is that Disney thinks there is no interest in that content over here. Or maybe they don’t want to pay for subtitling it.US clients have to wait longer for things like the full MCU or Fox titles, but at least they know they will get them eventually. While European users are kept in the dark about ever getting this classic content...Has to go to HBO.It\\'s a scam. Bullshit content. Atleast on the Apple + channel. Are you kidding me. They release one movie or show every 2 months. There is NO content unless you like Opera Winfrey crap.Still not a scam, when did they say otherwise?Ok maybe scam is the wrong word here. We can say false advertising. There is like 10 shows on that channel. You know it\\'s not worth $5. Come on dude.>You know it\\'s not worth $5. Arent most Apple+ users getting it free with an Apple product purchase anyway? I dont know if a single Apple+ user that signed up and is paying full price.It might be a DRM issue. You might be surprised to find only \\'approved\\' TVs and monitors that support HDCP 2.2 can play 4K from official sources.Not true. 4K works on the Nvidia Shield but wont display HDR on an HDR TV. Been like that for me since launch.Prime, Netflix etc work fine with HDR on the Shield for me.I looked into that and my Monitor is HDCP 2.2, so it shouldn\\'t be a DRM issue. Also other 4K apps and content, like Netflix, require HDCP 2.2 are working just fine.Really, that\\'s good to know. Why would support of told me it\\'s beuase it\\'s not HDR. I might try and pick up a second hand Shield now though.Uh, no.  You\\'re unique in that experience.  2019 shield here and 4k DV with atmos works perfectly in Disney+.  It\\'s Prime that\\'s not playing 4k HDR right now on the Shield.Weird I get 4K HDR on my Shield with D+ always have. Now if I change to a non HDR video setting I don\\'t get 4k either.No idea. The app is so flaky across all devices imho.I get 4K 5.1 on my 2015 Shield using a Philips Ambilight UHD TV.I get HD 5.1 on Sky Q D+.HD HDR10 5.1 on my LG TV (Go figure that one out!)HD 5.1 on a Galaxy S10It has become commonly known that Disney+ is only 4k with HDR.  If your system doesn\\'t support HDR then you won\\'t get 4k.  You are not alone in experiencing this and it\\'s not a bug.You weren\\'t lied to or told something wrong by Disney+ support.2015 Shield here. HDR works on everything else with no problems at all. Other devices too.Who knows what the issue is. D+ is very touchy about what it chooses to work properly with.Prime works fine for me too. Especially the UHD HDR live soccer a few months back.Wow, that\\'s crazy. I wonder if connecting a 5.1 headset to my Xbox might trick it into 4K.I wasn\\'t lied to by Disney+ support. But I was definitely lied to..The Disney+ home Page;\"Enjoy the big screen on your TV, or watch on your tablet, laptop, phone and more. You can watch an ever growing selection of titles in 4K, plus you can stream on 4 screens at once, so everyone\\'s happy.\"What I find more disappointing is that a lot of less tech savvy people are probably going to go out and upgrade to 4K with a budget 4K TV just to find out that it won\\'t work.Didn\\'t work but it does now say HD 5.1 instead of just HD, so at least I know changing the Xbox settings does effect the app.Didn’t they add HDR recently? Is the Xbox/your tv doing it wrong.Did it ever work/look correctly?It has not been a problem on our system (Xbox One X + Samsung Q8). Do you use a receiver? What kind of TV do you have? Does other HDR content work from other streaming services on your Xbox?It looks just fine if I turn the brightness up, but then all my other content is too bright, so I am assuming it has something to do with the app...I have a Samsung TV as well, no external receiver, and yes, other streaming services display HDR content just fine. It\\'s just that with Disney+ the brightness is way lower compared to all the other apps....That’s really weird. Have you tried deleting the app, doing a hard reset of the TV and Xbox, and reinstalling the app? That would be what I’d try next.I guess I\\'ll have to try reinstalling it as a next step, yes...I just wanted to ask around if it was a known issue first.This article is from January (updated in February), but it explains why this happens to some titles on Disney+:[https://www.ign.com/articles/2020/01/03/heres-why-disney-plus-is-losing-pirates-of-the-carribean-and-home-alone](https://www.ign.com/articles/2020/01/03/heres-why-disney-plus-is-losing-pirates-of-the-carribean-and-home-alone)Streaming deals are very weird. They are often written so that it says something like \"We will be allowed to have this title from 2014 to 2019, and also for 2026\". For instance, Disney and Netflix had a streaming agreement a few years ago where their movies would be on Netflix after seven or eight months and most of them ended 2019/2020. However, there was a stipulation in the contract that they will also have them in 2026. So in 2026 a lot of Disney titles will leave Disney+ and go to Netflix.Happy Christmas I guessWhich country ?It seems that FuboTV now has itI just wish we got the next pirates movie They could easily go for another but I think they will make a reboot or remake insteadAlso pirates 4 isn’t on there either but it doesn’t even hope at all on the appI though that was salazars revenge?This was my past job. And yes it is weird that way. But it allows the content owners to maximize their revenue. This contract periods also are usually part of a negotiation point.USOnly in some countries.All the star wars movies as I love them go from 1-9 before you watch episode 4 you need to watch solo and rouge one as they explain some stories in-between 3 and 4 I would watch solo before rouge one due to the ending of rouge one I started watching the clone wars (currently on season 1 episode 10) it’s good Watch all 6 seasons plus 7 then watch rebels all seasons of itThe mandalorian (takes place after episode 6) is good so watch all 8 episodes of it (some countries only have 3 while others have 8)If you really want to watch them in order Clone wars series takes place between 2 and 3 so if u watch movies then before 3 watch clone wars The rebels takes place between 3 and 4 so same thing with that oneClone Wars is fantastic.

I noticed that they kept the UK cut of Lilo and Stitch tumble drier scene.I\\'m located in Spain but watching all content in English. If I search for \"Moana\" the title of the film is like in the US but the actual film and songs call her Vaiana.It’s seems a bit random.

I live in Manchester UK2 are released per week until we catch upSame reason why Hercules TAS, Emperor\\'s New School and Talespin aren\\'t on UK Disney+.I think Disney is trying to steer away from bingeing culture. Same reason why they are only releasing one episode of The Mandalorian a week when the whole season is on Disney Plus in America. Or the High School Musical series. When the second seasons of these shows drop later in the year they don’t want people to expect to get the whole season at once so they’re sticking to a weekly release so everyone gets used to it. At least with Clone Wars they are releasing 2 episodes a week so we can catch up to America before the season finishes.And that reason is?More like they don\\'t want people to binge the newer series. The older cartoons and shows are all bingeable.I am fine with getting one episode per week, but we are 2 episodes behind the US for no reason besides them holding the UK release of Disney Plus back, they should release all episodes that are out and then give us one episode a week.No-one knows.If they did that you’d rush watch them then complain you had to wait for a new episode. There’s no winning with entitlement.I said I am fine waiting for each weeks episodes not episodes leaving me behind the online community forcing me to ignore spoilers. That\\'s not entitlement, I just want to same content other paid users are getting.What we (european users) are asking is to be able to watch Clone Wars at the same time as the US. We are paying the same price for the service and still we have to download the episodes online if we want to keep up with the series; it\\'s just ridiculous.  I don\\'t know how it is in Disney+ UK, but at least in Spain, episodes from series such as Ducktales (2017) are out of order, in other series episodes are missing for no apparent reason (Tangled, for example)... I heard that these problems happened in when the platform launched in the US, and it is understandable, but not when you launch it in different territories almost four months later.YesNo. The Jeff Goldblum show is up in full.Nothing streams live on D+.  Content usually gets released shortly after midnight (PST)Disney nature does seem like a great Disney+ original cause they are decent films and they don’t always make a lot at the box officeIt\\'s my firm belief that all nature documentaries should be narrated by Sir David Frederick Attenborough. Just something about his voice and narrative style that makes everything more amazing and delightful.Trailer: https://youtu.be/58xTMQrSLj4Press Release: BURBANK, Calif. (March 26, 2020) – In recognition of Earth Month, Disney+ announced today the Disneynature film “Elephant,” narrated by Meghan, The Duchess of Sussex, will premiere on April 3 alongside previously announced “Dolphin Reef,” with narration by Academy Award®-winning actress Natalie Portman. Following its theatrical release last year, the Disneynature film “Penguins” will also make it’s Disney+ debut on April 3. The Earth Month collection on Disney+ will also contain additional Disneynature titles premiering on the service on April 3 including “In the Footsteps of Elephant,” “A Life on the Edge” and “Diving with Dolphins” which give viewers behind-the-scenes access into the unique filmmaking process of all three films. These captivating films will join an already robust collection of animal and nature titles highlighted throughout the month including National Geographic’s “America’s National Parks,” “Wild Yellowstone,” “The Flood,” “JANE,” “Before the Floods,” “Planet of the Birds,” “Sea of Hope: America’s Underwater Treasures,” “Kingdom of the White Wolf,” “Tree Climbing Lions,” Hostile Planet” and “Wild Russia.” Directed by Mark Linfield, co-directed by Vanessa Berlowitz and Alastair Fothergill, and produced by Mark Linfield, Vanessa Berlowitz and Roy Conli, “Elephant” follows African elephant Shani and her spirited son Jomo as their herd make an epic journey hundreds of miles across the vast Kalahari Desert. Led by their great matriarch, Gaia, the family faces brutal heat, dwindling resources and persistent predators, as they follow in their ancestor’s footsteps on a quest to reach a lush, green paradise. In recognition of “Elephant,” Disneynature and the Disney Conservation Fund are supporting Elephants Without Borders, an organization working in Botswana to ensure people and elephants thrive.  Elephants Without Borders is working on strategies to protect Botswana’s elephant haven, helping to reduce human-wildlife conflict through education, economic development, and solutions that either redirect elephant migration away from people, or provide communities with tools that help to protect themselves and their properties when elephants are nearby. “Dolphin Reef” dives under the sea to frolic with some of the planet’s most engaging animals: dolphins. Created with Disneynature’s signature storytelling style, the film introduces Echo, a young Pacific bottlenose dolphin who can’t quite decide if it’s time to grow up and take on new responsibilities. Dolphin society is tricky, and the coral reef that Echo and his family call home depends on all of its inhabitants to keep it healthy. But Echo has a tough time resisting the many adventures the ocean has to offer. Keith Scholey, who directed Disneynature’s “Bears,” helms the film. Disney has a long history of supporting oceans and marine life around the world. Grants from the Disney Conservation Fund and expertise from Disney Conservation Team Wildlife have helped leading conservation organizations and communities to establish coral nurseries to help to re-grow their damaged reefs, build fisheries that save fish and provide local job opportunities, rescue stranded dolphins, and inspire children to explore and protect coastlines, reefs and other marine habitats.Jesus Christ, didn\\'t they just sign that deal with Meghan only a month ago? And they\\'ve already produced and recorded something with her? Pretty fast turn around!Meghan Markle?  \\\\*click\\\\*  \\\\*dial tone\\\\*💩💩The Disney nature films are the only other nature films I watch other than attenborough. That being said if they could ever find a way to do a Disney nature series with attenborough in the same vein as planet Earth or our planet. That will most likely become my favorite series of all timeMan that trailer is corny.There were reports that she did the job back in December I think. Before it was made known that she made the deal. The MPAA initially rated In the Footsteps of Elephants on 12/24. They also subsequently rated Elephants so it’s a bit unclear if they are the same movie and if there was a different narrator for the first one.She\\'s just doing the narration. That wouldn\\'t take long to record.In the Footsteps of Elephants is the featurette, just like Diving with the Dolphins and Life on the Edge are the featurettes for Penguins and Dolphin Reef. April 3rd is a busy day for them which is nice since between now and then they have nothing notable... Would be nice if they added what they SAID they were going to add weeks agoWicked Tuna Outer Banksmore Wicked TunaThree on The RunI Captured the King of the LeprechaunsZorro season 1&#x200B;but that would be asking too muchAre you watching in 4K? I’ve found that the Roku Ultra isn’t great for Disney+ because it’s limited to HDR10 and Disney+’s HDR10 is way inferior to their Dolby Vision HDR. I wish Roku would add Dolby Vision support. Had to upgrade to Apple TV and now the image is far superior to the Roku.Yes we are watching in 4K but we’ve never had a problem with it before...why do you think all of a sudden this is happening?I always had HDR10 issues with Roku Ultra. Ever since the November launch. It’s a shame it doesn’t support Dolby Vision.OMG they did it (albeit one week later)!&#x200B;And they added Outer Banks seasons 1-6!&#x200B;Now.. if only they would add Three on The Run and Zorro.... they had promised those as well...They\\'re adding originals all the time. For TV shows, *Disney Insider* was added on March 20 and  *Be Our Chef*  was added today. Movies had *Stargirl* added on March 13, and *Dolphin Reef* and *Elephant* will be added next week, along with a few shorts.Monsters at Work is coming out sometime in early spring 2021, the p&f movie is coming sometime in late summer of this year, and season 2 of Mando will arrive sometime in early fallHonestly, with the Covid-19 issue, the safety of the crew and people around them matter more. The animation people - a lot can work remotely, so they may have more interruptions and such, but I expect they\\'ll stay more on track.Unfortunately when it comes to originals Disney is really dry at the moment but by 2021 we will be getting originals left and right that are actually worth the buy rather than these originals we’ve been getting.He literally said \\'\\'Scripted\\'\\'Not currently, maybe in the future.Thanks.They shot Avengers in a taller aspect ratio (1.85:1 - width to height ratio) specifically to fit the hulk in the same frame as the other characters because of his greater height. Almost all the other mcu movies are a wider aspect ratio (2.39:1) common to conveying bigger scope through wider landscapes, often people say that “feels more cinematic” partly because we’re used to the black bars on the top and bottom. The first Ant-Man is also the taller 1.85:1 aspect ratio to emphasize the shifting height and scale of Ant-Man when he shrinks by having more space above and below him when he is smaller in the frame.Yep. That\\'s how it was filmed. If you ever want some clarity on these things just check the trailers. I do this often.Thank you very much for this reply I\\'m not too familiar with Movies 😂Alright thanksYou’re welcome, I hope that helped!If you’re in Europe Disney has reduced streaming quality to lighten the load on infrastructure.I\\'m in the UK, I\\'ve asked and looked around and people are still getting 4K res just at a lower bitrate.https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/fo5c07/uk_4k/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=shareMy issue is more that the Disney Plus app doesn\\'t detect that it should be streaming 4K. I\\'m having no real luck apart from learning that Disney Plus can stream 4K but the app might not be able to detect your monitor is 4K so defaults to HD.From what I\\'ve guessed so far is that Disney Plus streams in 4K but only 4K HDR10 at 60hz and then again only if the app detects that your TV is 4K HDR10 at 60hz. I\\'m just trying to see if I\\'m right.What I can say is that on Disney+ launch day when I still had to screen mirror the 4K/hdr was atrocious. However after the release of the official app on my Vizio the 4K and HDR has improved very slightlyThe quality of the HDR was always good. People are just dumb. Just because you *can* have a certain brightness level with HDR doesn’t mean you *need* to, or even that you should. Its peak brightness was *always* over 100 nits, which means it was *always* true HDR. And anyone who says otherwise simply doesn’t understand HDR.It’s a stupid thing to worry about. Either enjoy the show, or don’t. But if the quality of the HDR is going to impact your enjoyment, you probably need help. Note; this is not aimed at a particular person, but rather the corporate “you”.the fact that you cant see much in dark scenes because of bad hdr optimisation is definitely impacting enjoyment even for people that dont need helpWhat a dumbass, sorry mate but don\\'t see how barely being able to make out scenes because of poor implementation means that \" I need help \".I agree with your point. I have seen and definitely enjoyed mandalorian but I\\'m paying for the advertised 4k HDR and I would like to get that.Sorry mate, but if you read the original post, nowhere does it mention being too dark to see. Rather it mentions benchmark measurements. If you’re upset that you’re not getting the maximum contrast ratio possible, from an online stream, you need help. If you can’t make out scenes, that’s something to complain about. I’m sorry they didn’t teach you you use context to help with your reading comprehension, Dumbass.You should definitely cancel and demand a refund. Oh, and see if they can give you the time you spent watching an obviously inferior display back. /sSo it’s Disney employees on a cooking show with their kids to win a Disney cruise? Uh...I didn’t know they were employees.... and here I was thinking that the grand prize was already lame enough.First episode at least one of the chefs talked about working at DisneyWorld.Oh man i remember seeing meet the deedles in theaters... and it was....not good. Country Bears is way worse though. Meet the deedles can be fun with right help.Country Bears sucks.[Blackbeard\\'s Ghost](https://www.disneyplus.com/movies/blackbeards-ghost/1jsRy2jlLTTH). The description happens in like the last 10 minutes of the movie. The rest is just Blackbeard getting the coach into trouble because the coach doesn\\'t want his help, and a professor willing to date the coach, even though she thinks he\\'s clinically insane. Plus three old ladies trying to save their hotel from an evil land developer.Luck of the Irish. Only watch if very drunk and as MST3K material. You know what, I\\'m just going to make a separate thread looking for Disney movies that would make good MST3K material.Spider-Man Unlimited.Sweet jesus, Spider-Man UnlimitedRace to Witch Mountain with The Rock is pretty bad.Any of the Sunday night Disney movies like bedknobs and broomsticks. If it\\'s old and you haven\\'t heard of it there is a reason for that.A lotI\\'ve always wanted to watch that movie. So I should avoid it at all costs then? It\\'s that bad?Take that back >:(The Christopher Walken scenes are amazing though.I definitely disagree with this one. My brother and I loved Blackbeard\\'s Ghost as kids. Maybe the nostalgia factor had an effect, but I watched it a few months ago on a work trip and really enjoyed it and felt like it totally held up. So I told my wife to watch it, and I think she enjoyed it too.I have weird nostalgia for this as the local TV station played terrible Disney movies every morning in summer when we were off school and this is the one I remember most.I remember liking that movie a lot as a little kid. I\\'m talking like 5-8. It\\'s definitely not a good film but someone that young might find that movie entertaining and enjoy it.That movie is a classic and one of Disney\\'s best, not to mention one of the last that had input from Walt even though he died several years before it came out.>If it\\'s old and you haven\\'t heard of it there is a reason for that.With all due respect, that\\'s poor logic. r/TIL is enough evidence that there are *lots* of things people should have heard of by now but haven\\'t. Just because you haven\\'t heard of it doesn\\'t mean it wasn\\'t good.That’s very short sighted.  I loved that movie growing up. If you’re a kid now, then of course you wouldn’t know the movie. Doesn’t make it bad. I also fondly remember Darby O’gill and the Little PeopleI actually enjoy country bears and have watched it twice on Disney plus, but I did grow up with it. It kinda toes the line of so bad it’s good, but has funny jokes in it that come out of nowhere. Also, I believe the defunctland YouTube channel did a podcast with one of the puppeteers and hearing her talk about the passion and craftsmanship that went into making the movie gives me a better appreciation for it all.Wait...what?WHAT?!Christopher Walken is in the Country Bears movie?I just went and checked IMDB to make sure this wasn\\'t a joke. Christopher Walken is in the Country Bears movie. Now I have to watch it.Me too for both Bedknobs & DarbyIm 45. Couldn\\'t stand it.I really enjoyed it too, but didn’t watch it until I was an adult. I don’t remember much of it as it’s been about 10 years since I watched, but I know I liked it.1 week late. I just wish they had added Zorro which was also supposed to go up last week.I know a really terrible Disney movie. Inspector Gadget. I didn’t hate it when I was a kid, but I didn’t find out how awful it was until I saw the Nostalgia Critic’s review.I have a massive nostalgia soft spot for Mr Bogedy, but I could absolutely see it fitting into this category.Food Boy. Worst best Disney movie ever.Don\\'t take The Nostalgia Critic too seriously.I won’t. I only watch his reviews ironic comedy, not as reviews. If I want serious reviews, I watch Chris Stuckmann or other reviewers.On PS4 it keeps telling me it can’t connect to Disney plusWhere are you from?UKIt could be due to the Corona-Virus outbreak. Disney+ is reducing their bandwith due to that.Also in the UK and mine seems to be topping out at 720p (according to the Fire TV dev tools)I\\'m from Germany and via my SamsungTV App, I\\'ll get HD and HDR but nothing more. I would wait until everything is somewhat „back to normal“.the guy is wrong, though, prime video doesn\\'t have it. which is why prime video sucks!Prime video has it in America I believe but will be rolling it out to different countries in the futureAmazon has rolled out profiles overseas.The feature is currently available in India, and as u/matts142 pointed out, the feature is available in the States. So, in the context of India, every streaming app except the homegrown ones that don\\'t really matter (except Hotstar) has this feature, as does Disney+ abroad, which would be unfair if it didn\\'t come to India when Hotstar becomes Disney+ Hotstar.Can someone please explain to me how to get user profiles on prime video because my understanding is it\\'s impossible and I was told that by their staff. at least on the student prime maybe that\\'s the issue...The US was a new episode every Friday, so it\\'ll probably be the same in Europe.That’s why disney is only good for a month. Watch the old stuff and unsub. Dropping their only good series weekly is crap!Really annoys me that they don\\'t drop everything at once. Defiently a huge negative and a reason to unsubscribe.Yeah, we got the first episode immediately when the service went live on a Tuesday and then all the rest released on Fridays.Thanks mate.They don’t want people to binge watch it all and then cancel their subscription.They can when every episode is released.Potentially - depends on Disney\\'s plan on rolling out its streaming services. Might be later in the year that you get access. Does Spain have it already?Isle of Man and Channel Islands are getting it on the 2nd April, so check then.Thanks :) I will!2-8 and half of 9.My favourite is 3 for the way it brilliantly mingles the show\\'s down-to-earth origins with increasingly absurd humour, but anything from S2-7 is golden, and S1 is very interesting to see how the show developed.Season 1 isn\\'t great, but anything from 2 to 10 is superb.65 thru 99. Has some of the most legendary episodes like „The City of New York vs Homer Simpson“ and „Simpson Tide“.Season 6 is my favourite, but the first 10 are all so good. Also \"Holidays of Future Passed\" from Season 23 is my favourite HD era episodes that people should see.4 maybe?The show changes quite a bit over its first decade. I assume it does over the other two decades as well, but I mostly haven’t seen those yet.first 10 are incredible tbh, but I can\\'t watch the first 3 seasons cause the way they upscaled it hurts my eyes. The screen is all shaky and stuff.2-10 aree the classic seasons. Personally I would call 2-15 classic, but others may disagree. I will also add though that I still love the show it just has less great episodes per season. So maybe sample em all?I think season 4 is fantastic as well.Ye i get that but i dont really mind itYou can make a new profile and have that be your own one without those recommendations, and give the old profile to your sister.No.No, I think the only streaming service that offers this option is HuluTHIS. Why are you all using 1 profile? Make your own new profile and she uses the other one.Netflix also allows thisShe does have her own profile but she decided to use mine for some reason. I\\'ll probably end up making a new account for myself though, cheers :)Add to this list of services, Prime Video also allow you to edit your watch history.You don\\'t need to make a new account. Just make a new profile for yourself. Additionally, if she rarely watched anything on her profile just remove that one.Yeah, profile is what I meant, my badNo official announcement either way.Seems like it will only be released in the US for nowI’m wondering when it’ll be on Disney+ in Canada, whether I should buy it or hold off.probably the same as for germany. it will release sometime later in 2020, probably autumnThanksThat\\'s a no.  I\\'d love to remunerated.It says it on the side: \"This is a fan-run community in no way authorized, sponsored or endorsed by Disney+ or the Walt Disney Company.\"Why would you assume yes?The correct answer is no, but why would you assume yes?>I assume yes,The safe assumption for *any* subreddit is NOWhy would this reddit channel [sic.] or any moderator need any affiliation with Disney?Why do you assume yes?Why did you want to check?Why are you like this?There\\'s nothing official, but sometimes things that get brought up on reddit/twitter get noticed by Disney, especially if you tweet @DisneyPlusHelpA lot of the time, it\\'ll be \"thanks for your feedback!\" but it\\'s always worth a try.Thanks, I wanted to double check.Would you mind testing it on a browser? Chrome or the old Edge? I just cannot get more than 720p and it is frustrating.&#x200B;If you open a film (use one which you know is 100% sure 4K), press \"Ctrl+Shift+ . \", and one window will appear. Scroll down a bit, and you will see the resolution.In my case is always \"1280x720\"...I believe one way of doing this is for one person in the U.K. and another in the US to use the “system X-ray” function on their Amazon Fire TV. I’m not all that certain though.I think they said there\\'ll be a 25-30% bandwith limitation, I\\'m assuming we\\'re losing access to UHD, HDR and Dolby Atmos.Have they given any indication of when this is all gonna be sorted? Or is it a “how long is a piece of string?” Kinda situationIn the UK, just did this. I see both 4K and HdrResolution on the Mandalorian and Solo which are in widescreen is 2560 x 1440. Bitrate was 5565UK has 4K, HDR, but no Atmos. I’m curious about the bitrate and “true resolution” of the 4K HDR titles.Yikes. 1440p? Even with COVID situation they shouldn’t say 4K. I’d hate to trouble you again, but would you know if HD content is 1080p or 720p?By 5565 you mean 5,565 Mb/s?It’s down from 17mbps to 7mbps for 4K HDRI think (but might be wrong) that this is correct for widescreen 4K content- as the black bars aren’t streamed the resolution being steamed is below full 4k 2160Kb/s. So that\\'s 5.565 Mb/s.How did you get these numbers?The 4k resolution, without black bars, should look similar to this: 3840x1608. That\\'s 4K without black barsBlimey! That\\'s a Netflix HD level bitrate. Shambles to pitch it as 4k at that data rate.Amazon Firestick in Developer mode mateI just checked Toy Story 3 which is full screen (not widescreen) “4k”. Still 1440p and low bit rate. Streamed 4K on the Apple TV app which did show full 4k, so my internet is definitely capable of 4k. DisappointingSo it’s definitely not full 4k then, which I’m pleased about because it definitely doesn’t look amazingOther forums are saying the HD is 720p. That means Now TV Boost are streaming these Disney titles at a higher resolution than Disney+.Ooh nice, you\\'re still getting full 4k right?Hello  thank you for your previous response. May I also trouble you by asking what res and bitrate your getting for HD content?Oof, if I knew it was this bad I would have not taken the Pre Order offer. BT said their network infrastructure is well enough in capacity to take on huge internet traffic so don\\'t understand why the SVOD need to act like the internet is on its last legs and hit the consumer really hard.As far as we can tell at the moment: 4K Content is not 4K. It\\'s 1440p. We don\\'t know if HD is 1080p or 720p yet, I have a feeling it might be 720p.Wow... I thought the Netherlands was behind on classic Disney content, but it looks like we missed out on a fairly large number of Fox and NatGeo titles as well. We are really treated like second-class customers here... EXTREMELY disappointing!Wow you guys have a MUCH, MUCH better library than US right now. It\\'s asinine to think we\\'re looking at 2023 or later to catch up if all those Fox titles are stuck at HBO. They really need to try and buy their way out of the contract in the US. A lot of those titles are great. I can\\'t believe Edward Scissorhands is going to be a Disney Plus movie!Why is there different contracts for each country? This is literally not fair at all lmaoLucky assesI’m excited for Edward Scissorhands!!Lucky!that must suckneither can II\\'m no lawyer, but my guess is that film campaniles design contracts one country at a timeyepThese shows are PG-13 so I don’t see anything wrong with themI wonder why Malcolm is on here, wasn’t it originally supposed to be a launch title from their tweet thread?Why Modern Family wasn\\'t available day one is beyond me. The show is the type of show that belongs on Disney+&#x200B;But anyway, yes to all of these please!Why do we need to select? If they own the property right of all these shows, why not just release everything?No X-Files?!I\\'d rather have King of the HillThis better mean they\\'re gonna give Hillary Duff her PG-13 Lizzie McGuire.Yesss Firefly is such a good show tbh. I hope they bring it back! Buffy the Vampire Slayer too!I don’t understand why they can’t just release them and have an option for users to enable or disable them.They own How I Met Your Mother?Also, I already own the Firefly Blu-Ray so I will be voting for black-ish.Too Bad Bob\\'s Burgers isn\\'t on the list; I\\'d Choose THAT one in a Heartbeat!!Give me Firefly in 4K you cowards.Everyone needs to vote for Malcolm in the Middle! It is important!Open the floodgates I say. Would help them compete with other streaming servicesI suppose if they do add Buffy,they\\'d also add the original theatrical movie Fox madePerhaps this is what this tweet was referring to  [https://twitter.com/ManaByte/status/1241545437787475968](https://twitter.com/ManaByte/status/1241545437787475968)Yes to all please, and Bobs Burgers.BOB\\'S BURGERS!!!!!!!! ...(inhale) BOB\\'S BURGERS!!!!!!!!!!Don’t get me wrong, I am thoroughly enjoying Disney+ at the moment. The content is great, the back catalogue is outstanding, and the overall experience is fantastic, but I do think it’s going to get old sooner rather than later. I’ll find something to watch anytime, but there’s Fox’s entire catalogue to use and just because it’ll be 12+ shouldn’t be a reason to not add it to the platform.Ultimately, it will only help the service to broaden the content available. It won\\'t hurt their family-friendly branding to include any content (even higher rated stuff like Family Guy) since there\\'s already a dedicated kid-friendly interface.                  Dropping hotly-anticipated content like the Lizzie McGuire reboot and Love, Simon spin-off are very poor moves that won\\'t benefit the company in the long-run.          This is particularly notable here in the UK for a few reasons, besides some extra content Disney+ is essentially DisneyLife rebranded and I imagine the extra thrill of poorly-cropped Simpsons episodes will wear off quickly. Secondly, a lot of these ex-Fox properties that Disney gobbled up are not available to stream elsewhere, unlike in the US, as we don\\'t have Hulu here. So they\\'re essentially locking shows like FG and AD up in the Disney vault, which is counter-intuitive to the purpose of Disney+.Imagine Disney+ just put a Fox folder beside the marvel, Disney, Nat geo, lucasfilm and Pixar folders ? Now that would be a Service. I am speaking as a European here so Hulu does not exist over here.It’s Disney. They make more money every day than I would see in a lifetime.It baffles me how this mega-company cannot see that, in the streaming era, more content is always better. How can this corporation not implement settings where you can just restrict shows based on their ratings? How is there next to no customization at all?It would make sense to have your basic “children’s” profile, then customize profiles to allow pg13 content, tv-ma content, 14A content (in Canada) and/or any other parameters they want. How come they just don’t make this any easier? Instead we get Lizzie McGuire cancelled cuz sex is badIt’s MalcolmI want it allIt\\'s disappointing they\\'re surveying customers to curate content rather than opening their catalog so the service appeals long-term to all ages. Curating content is a short-term solution. They will need to open up their full catalog.Do they own Lost? Is love to rewatch that onei might rewatch firefly, finish buffy, and finally binge malcom in the middle.but i will *never* re-watch how i met your mother. that finale was terrible, and ruined the entire showWow does Disney own all those shows? I guess I didn’t realize. If they were on Disney plus I would absolutely keep it.Buffy and Firefly are TV-14 while the rest are TV-PGIf this survey does go well then you can expect shows like The Golden Girls, Baby Daddy, Bob\\'s Burgers, and Futurama to potentially make it on Disney+ in the near future.Also please note that Disney+ will not have any TV-MA or controversial TV-14 shows on the service which may be why Love Victor was moved to Hulu.Happy to have more shows but i\\'m realistic in my expectations.I do think theres hundreds of 20th Century Fox films they could be adding though.Hopefully each of these shows make it onto Disney Plus because they are kinda lacking in bingeable content. Modern Family is like Disney’s answer to The Office and How I Met Your Mother is Disney’s answer to Friends. So heres hoping that they’re added.Yes Firefly, all five seasons!Glee? No? Okay. :(Good, I hope they add more because if everything stays little kidish I won\\'t be staying with them as much as I love Disney. We need more variety to choose from like with Netflix.Just give us Futurama pleaseIdk if Hulu is going to be rolled out internationally next year with everything going on. They’re losing money like crazy right now (not their fault, everyone is losing money so the big studios are all in the same boat) so the launch may be delayed whilst they pick themselves up and regroup.I know they’re never going to do it, but it would be cool to see Disney+ and Hulu integrated into one service (maybe on the home-screen, you could choose either D+ or Hulu. There would be a brief but minimalistic transition and boom, whichever content you wanted is at your fingertips) with better parental controls. That way Disney could keep their brand intact while older family members enjoy American Dad, Family Guy, etc.Y\\'all better be saying yes to Firefly.Suddenly the \"Plus\" part of Disney+ is making a lot more senseMalcolm in the middle 😭All of them 😂🖤With Modern Family ending, it\\'s appropriate to have that on the service.Literally no good reason to not have them.How about getting some older Fox series on that you can not stream anywhere, like Space Above and Beyond?Damnit who else clicked the picture and tried to do the survey hahaHOLD UP HOLD UP.....i thoght How i met your mother was CBS/Warner Bros?They’re giving the Lizzie McGuire reboot a hard time for “having adult themes”, but Buffy is first on their list? 🤔id literally watch all of them, more adult content is needed, you don\\'t even have to go above pg 13 to get that.Just a little FYI:  Any non-obscure show that has ever been on Fox is currently on Hulu in it\\'s entirety.Firefly ftwWheres family guyAHHHHHHH FIREFLY!!!! In all seriousness I would kill for more space westerns.i hope buffy gets on plus that one gets my vote.OPHow did you get the survey ?Email ? On the app ?FIREFLY AND BUFFY PLSModern Family too.Please let American dad onOh man Firefly is a throwback! I watched a couple seasons of Buffy but it never really hooked me like I thought it wouldI love modern family, how I met your mother and Malcom in the middle but I have them all on dvd so would like to try one of the other shows I bet modern family and Malcom in the middle will be fighting for first then it will be how I met your mother and then the restSome of the biggest fox shows Family guy (rated 15 so probably will not be on it)American dad (rated 15 and was a fox show but not anymore)24 (rated 15)King of the hill (rated 12 so could be on it)Futurama (rated 12 so could be on it)Bobs burgers (rated 12 could be on it)Glee (rated 12 but high 12)How I met your mother some of the dvds like discs are rated 15How long would this take for them to add one of these showsI\\'ll be shocked if Modern Family doesn\\'t make it onto the service.Come on Buffy!Come on Buffy!Goodreally want modern family on !!!It would be nice if they could fix Buffy\\'s HD remaster.Heres a link to the guy who got the survey https://twitter.com/Griddlemarks/status/1242666153094156288?s=20Many of you want Family guy and American dad.  Your not in luck cause Bob Iger has said before that those shows are too controversial for Disney+You can enjoy them on HuluMODERN FAMILY PLEASE! I binged like 6 or 7 seasons of it and lost track of it and it\\'s so annoying having to go to those sketchy sites to binge them.This gets more interesting. Buffy fans are in luck! [https://www.sausageroll.com.au/entertainment/shows/disney-to-announce-buffy-news-very-soon/](https://www.sausageroll.com.au/entertainment/shows/disney-to-announce-buffy-news-very-soon/)How could they get How I Met Your Mother if that was on CBS and probably locked on All AccessHow do i find this survey to answer?Release the beasts!!!Family profile and be done with it.Please god get Malcolm in the Middle on thereWhere did you receive this? Email? On the app?I wouldn\\'t mind if they added Modern familyI thought they wanted to keep the adult-oriented shows on Hulu?Can we get Dinosaurs the series?I NEED Malcolm in the Middle again. Since it got removed from Netflix. That show was my childhoodEasy winner here is Malcolm in the middle . What a show.They need to do two things. 1.\\tGive us better parental controls. Beyond Turing a kid profile on let us dictate which sections are appropriate for a profile to watch.2.\\tcreate a “Fox” section and put there more adult properties there.Where do I take this survey? How are people getting it?I was a kid when Buffy was at its peak and I remember it being a very popular show at school. Never actually watched it but I can\\'t imagine it\\'s that egregious content-wise.Haven\\'t watched Malcolm in years but I remember it being pretty tame, about Simpsons-level in comedy raunch.The others could all theoretically work. HIMYM is a head-scratcher to a degree but it\\'d be a decent addition to Disney Plus.Malcolm in the Middle is a show that needs to be put on D+ pronto, more people need to be exposed to the greatness of this show.Malcom In The Middle please......We all expected all of fox & Disney & marvel at some point, given the fact the got rid of live TV Disney plus  is only a little better than Disney life but still falls short at the same time, paraphrase one of your competitors Disney you have failed this community.I’m up for it. Disney should add a section for Fox movies and shows just like the others have. And their are shows that I did enjoy as I was growing up like How I Met Your Mother or Reba which are both my personal favorites. If they do they bring in more hours for people to watch and if they can, it would be a whole different experience.I mean, I’ve never seen firefly but I’d love the rest on Disney+. Plus, I’ve never seen Malcolm In The Middle so this would be a good way to watch, assuming they make it available in Canada too.Is \"All\" an option? Because I would choose that.If Firefly gets added I will be overjoyedDon’t they already own Hulu?Buffy buffy buffy plsssss 😍😍😍😍😍😍Can Disney+ give us a firefly reboot with Joss Whedon returningDisney+ should absolutely have more adult oriented content. I know that it’s Disney and family friendly but just from a business perspective you own so much content now with Fox imagine how many more subscribers you’d get with all the great series and moviesThey should have 24 and Boston Legal and NYPD Blue on there tooCan we all agree the musical episodes of Buffy was amazing?Is there a Disney Plus newsletter?Eh leave it on HuluBut isnt Disney\\'s whole purpose as a company to make content anyone (not just adults) can enjoyI’d much rather have these one Hulu. Make Hulu the Disney+ for grownups and keep Disney+ for kids and teenagers. Simpsons and Avatar already don’t belong there in my opinion.No thanks.Family guy where?Most of these are on Amazon videoThere is quite a lot of sex on BUFFY eg. there\\'s one episode that involves Buffy having sex with her boyfriend for the entire runtime. I LOVE BUFFY but that doesn\\'t scream Disney to me. Perhaps they could have +FOX as an additional subsection.[deleted]aschtially *pushes up glasses*these are TV-14Disney just needs to offer parental controls/options and this content should be fine.Maybe it’s because of contract maybe with different steaming service and will be on when it runs outIt’s on Hulu in the usExactly. I can only imagine it\\'s stupid licensing issues but I expected all of those shows to be there day one and have been so disappointed ever sinceAnd Malcom in the middle I heard I was to be on from day one (not that it matters as I have it on dvd)Maybe they can remake the last 3 seasons on Disney+That\\'s my question. If they\\'re going to overthrow Netflix, Disney would be crazy not to release as much content as they can. Particularly now with so many people at home, they could really come away with a ton of new subscribers if they added content. There\\'s way too little on the service for grown ups right now.They\\'re not really making users select anything. Just testing the waters for reception to the Fox/ABC pg13 shows. Despite what reddit will say, It\\'s still a service that got 30m subs in 3 months and is still fast growing with majority good audience satisfaction. It\\'s not a service that *needs* anything. It\\'s exactly what it\\'s advertised to be and people are buying it.They\\'re seeing some unprecedented success and are not desperate to do anything so they\\'re doing what most businesses in that position can/will do - Ask its users if it wants said addition before they proceedWait they own the rights to HIMYM?Because they also own Hulu. They can\\'t put everything on one service.They also have the \"Disney Brand\" to protect, which is their whole reason they have two services in the first place.I think it\\'s to see if people really want Disney+ to have some more edgy stuffIt\\'s a questionnaire...Wasn\\'t Buffy on the WB/CW?They want to make sure people are comfortable having these on a Disney branded serviceX files does have one or two tv-ma episodesIt\\'s on Hulu.And before people jump on the \"Hulu\\'s only in US\", remember Disney announced plans for Hulu international. Instead of asking for things that don\\'t fit the brand on D+, harp on them to speed up rollout of Hulu.And Bob\\'s Burgers.#***BWAAAAAAAAAH***Me tooI HOPE SOYasssssLast I heard...it\\'s been a while though...they\\'re working on a new Buffyverse show. Supposedly is to feature a new slayer, like they did with Faith, and also have Buffy appearing. I don\\'t believe the idea was to recast and reboot Buffy...because that would be blasphemy.There’s a firefly comic that’s really goodThey should have an option to block or allow 15+ content Like say if it’s a profile for your child you could block all 15+And the adults can allow that content by selecting with a on or off thingThey have a kids section lolVote for all... The service needs all of them...Yes, it aired on CBS but they don’t own the show, the distributor and production company does. Which was 20th Century Fox.Yes, the acquired the rights when the bought Fox.I own 3 of these shows on dvd and watch them all loads so would like to try one of the othersMaybe in the near future cause these shows are just some of the shows they asked and maybe with this feedback they will add bobs burgersNo I don\\'t get the hype around that show. People vote Himym or Black Ish!!Well those are all Pg13. I reckon those would have come on eventually. It\\'s r rated stuff that will never be on it ( which is ok imo )Does this mean that a lot of fox and abc shows they are pg-13 will be on the disney+ next monthYes indeed! However don\\'t expect them next month as Disney has already announced the content coming AprilDefinitely, and some of the marvel shows are going to be delayed it would’ve a good way to bridge the gap.I agreeYeah Love Victor was supposed to be their \\'\\'big summer\\'\\' program and would have debuted during Pride Month so it would have been in the middle of the gap before the MCU shows debutedThey won\\'t put a Fox filter because that brand has released R-rated films before and Disney is seperating that as much as they can.Because Disney has spent 80 years becoming the best \"family content\" brand in the world.And they are literally killing it at the box office by maintaining that.Becoming \"just like everyone else\" is a bad move for Disney.And there’s a reason why they make so much money. Why bring everything to Disney+ when you can sell people two streaming services with Hulu. Sure, they can increase Disney+ but they won’t go over well.It aired on ABC, so either outright “yes” or they have some sort of distribution rights to it still, since it’s on the ABC on demand menu.Lost is on HuluOmg...I freaking love HIMYM but that ending was seriously the worst in tv history. It felt like they got so wrapped up in giving us more crazy adventures of the characters that they lost track of what the show was about and didn\\'t know what to do with the end.Do what I do, whenever I watch the finale, I stop 2-3 minutes before the credits role, perfect endingAmen, maybe Disney will remake the finale hahaYes Disney owns ABC and FoxI can\\'t see why Simpsons is there but Futurama isn\\'t already.Yes but the deal with hbo expires 2022 so it will a while until more fox content shows upLol. If only there were that manyMaybe after it leaves Netflix? But I don’t think it will cause there is teen pregnancy and other topics that are too controversial. That’s why Love Victor had to move to HuluIsn\\'t Glee on Netflix?I would love to have Hulu part of Disney+ without paying for another subscription I am from the uk btwAll will come on at some point but the ones that will get most votes are modern family and Malcom in the middleIt aired on CBS, but was produced and distributed by 20th Century Fox, so I guess that means Disney owns it.Maybe they specifically don\\'t want Lizzie in super adult situations because she is a well known Disney character?I still want my PG-13 Lizzie tho lolAnother FYI: Hulu is only available in the United States, while Disney+ is available in 12 countries and counting.Too controversial for Disney+From a twitter user who was given the survey https://twitter.com/Griddlemarks/status/1242666153094156288?s=20That one is unlikely and so is Family Guy cause of controversial contentBut for people who live in countries without HuluBob Iger isn’t in charge anymore. Or he won’t be in a couple monthsIt is produced by FoxOnly select people got itA twitter user got thisThat’s for shows that are too controversial or TV-MA in this case all these shows are TV-PG and TV-14its on HuluThey won\\'t put a Fox filter because that brand has released R-rated films before and Disney is seperating that as much as they can.Only select people got itThey willWhen you click on them you have to say \\'\\'yes\\'\\' or \\'\\'no\\'\\' so if you say yes to all of them then sureYes but thats for their TV-MA and controversial TV-14 showsI mean these shows may be adult but are still popular in young adults and have most have been passed down by a generationI don’t think they should cause most people haven’t touched Disney+ in a while so Disney really needs this. Also there may be a possibility these shows will be shared between both servicesDisney\\'s whole purpose is to make content for everyone in the family. Disney+ has recently been ignoring the older parts of the family who do not want to watch Frozen 2 like million timesNone of those shows are adult as in r rated. They\\'re all pg13Wait If Disney owns abc and fox don’t they then make 15+ stuffIf they continue doing guess you can say goodbye to Disney+ lolFamily guy will never be on d+. All these shows are pg13/tv14. family guy is notIger has said before that Family guy and American Dad are way too controversial for Disney+On huluAny non-obscure show that has ever been on Fox is currently on Hulu in it\\'s entirety.Boy Meets World is already on Disney+, and there are later episodes about how horny Cory is and how badly he wants to sleep with Topanga. Not as extreme, but there\\'s a precedent.And there is barely covered nudity in at least 4 episodes of Firefly, plus one of the characters is a prostitute. Plus, if you are Chinese, they are saying very foul language.No, please not an additional subscription. You can have fox content off by default, fine whatever, but please don’t make people pay extra.I refer to Season Six of Buffy as Season Sex.I LOVE this idea! :)There\\'s also a whole episode dealing with an attempted rape. Great show, but bold move if they put it on Disney+.Outside of the USA Hulu isn\\'t available (still!) So I\\'d love if Disney had more available beyond 7 and under movies etc.can you advise what episode? for research purposes?I think we\\'d all be okay with memory holing that episode out of existenceYou sound funIts on Hulu now so i cant imagine they couldnt port it over whenever they wanted, at least to the USI mean, licensing issues are likely the reason, but at least D/D+ are respecting their contracts instead of pulling the hierarchy card  and doing whatever they want, just because they can. Personally, I’d have voted for HIMYM. Though much of its content is culturally outdated (can’t help but cringe at moments I previously pined for), it’s still hugely popular. And they could be figuring out what happens if Hulu adds FRIENDS to their roster, and “loses” HIMYM to D+. Personally, I think they’re just seeing if D+ subscribers would even be willing to watch the aforementioned shows if they were on D+. Otherwise, they’ll send them to Hulu.>They\\'re not really making users select anything. Just testing the waters for reception to the Fox/ABC pg13 shows.

Just like everyone here is already surprised that many of these title are owned by Disney. Please Disney, don\\'t hesitate on adding any pg13 shows. This is the only way for Disney to EASILY surpass netflix.The thing is the service is still new and more and more people are complaining about lack of content so Disney needs to do something.Fox produced it so yeahThey own Fox .I thought they would of just had a fox section on the app for more adult contentREMAKE THE FINALE DISNEYHulu is only in the States why can\\'t they just add a fox section to the app? Of Course people want more adult material on the app . Ive had Netflix for years, doesn\\'t mean my kids watch adult material on it. That\\'s what the children\\'s accounts are for.Buffy was produced and owned by Fox, along with Angel. That\\'s why Buffy was able to move from the WB to UPN for it\\'s last two seasons.I’m assuming the one where momma is under the bed? The mere thought of that episode still gives me the creeps.I know it’s on Hulu... And it’s not like it “doesn’t fit the brand”. It’s a PG-13 franchise.And American dadBoth on Hulu currentlyThis might help those shows get addedBobs burgers is on prime in the uk I have all of king of the hill on dvd btwYes I believe they’re working on that. I’d still like to rewatch the classic series though. [https://www.sausageroll.com.au/entertainment/shows/disney-to-announce-buffy-news-very-soon/](https://www.sausageroll.com.au/entertainment/shows/disney-to-announce-buffy-news-very-soon/)Shows you what I know, don\\'t it? :P Thanks for the info.I Sure hope so!!!!Bob\\'s burgers is my Favorite Adult Show because it\\'s the most heartwarming show aimed at adults; that also has the Healthiest depiction of Marriage in TV HistoryLmao we are voting yes on all of themYeah all the rated r content can go to hulu, disney+ can absolutely play a healthy balance from content for children to popular pg13 titles for the adults.Like family guy, American dad, 24 etc etcPossibly. But nothing is confirmedA pin for adult content . After all it\\'s adults that are paying for it. It won\\'t compete with netflix without Adult content .Redditors or even people online in general often forget that they are most likely not the target audience for a lot of things.I’d drop Hulu in an instant and pay more for Disney+ if it were to get more contentLost was made by ABC, aired on ABC long after Disney owned ABC. So they exclusively own it and it\\'s a fantastic show about people having no or poor direction in life and overcoming it. The sci-fi elements of it get weaker in the end but the cast and their writing is great.Yes I know.It is, but it\\'d be nice for it to be on Disney+ as well.I know how that feels— I’m Canadian and when D+ was initially announced I thought that meant we were getting Hulu as well. I’d use both and probably ditch Netflix for Hulu tbh. If they were merged into one service with an option to pick which programming you wanted (Hulu or D+), that would be a dream come true.Ahhh thanks for clarifyingHulu will be rolling out worldwide next yearBut his plan will remain as Disney+ won\\'t ever have content that is too controversial.Well Hulu is not available in most countries such as the ukThere was a fox family channel at one point, nothing stopping you from doing a “Fox Teen” and dumping titles that are a bit stronger in there. With proper controls they be fine to put Fox stuff in Disney+. Additionally, I highly doubt Hulu stays around forever. At some point they will consolidate the two services (likely after they buy out the rest of The shares of Hulu in 2023?). There’s a reason it’s still not available in most countries while Disney+ is rolling out everywhere.That is horrible. They should send one to all users. They\\'ll have a better data graph that way.OkYesI got Disney+ and I downloaded season 20-31 of the Simpsons as they not on dvd seen them twice and now watching them on disney+ so if they take Simpsons off I would have one less reason to open disney+I live in the ukThe season 1-19 I have on dvdYeah it is? Family guys always been TV14.Oh thanks, didnt know thatHulu isn\\'t available outside of the US thoughHocus Pocus talks aboutvirgins throughout (when I was a kid I had no idea what that word meant) but Buffy shows quite a lot of on screen sex.The Simpsons has a lot of sex too. It\\'s all cut-away and then back when the act is done, but still. Made me wonder why the Lizzie McGuire reboot having some sexual themes was a problem, even more so if they\\'re actually considering adding Buffy or How I Met Your Mother.Why not bring up The Simpsons over Boy Meets World?Sex is *discussed* in very many shows currently on Disney+, but anything approximating actual sex happens offscreen.Splash is on Disney+ and that is nudityMy understanding of their comment is that it would be a new section just like Star Wars and Pixar are sections within the Disney+ app. I didn’t assume new subscription, which I agree would suck. I would think they could make it where you lock the FOX content via password or something for people with children.Additional sub*section* not additional sub*scription*Hehe you geniusSeason 4, episode 18 - \"Where the wild things are\"I heard people saying it runs out December 2020 so might go to Disney+ then But maybe all the Hulu shows could be on Disney+ outside of America as most countries don’t have HuluFriends is being added to HBO MaxThere seeing success because people are stuck in the home with the kids and kids like DisneyWhat does abc have to do with Disney They own foxI want to see more marvel shows like the daredevil and punisherAgreed completelyHIMYM is a show that they at the very least should put up on Hulu.  It doesn\\'t have to be an all or nothing situation of it being on D+ or not at all.  All of the shows that they don\\'t want to put on D+ should just put them on Hulu instead.  HIMYM is one of the staples of streaming series, it\\'s basically one of the required binge type of shows right alongside shows like Breaking Bad, Friday Night Lights, Game of Thrones, yada yada.Neat, didn\\'t realize thatThe episode began with a child being buried alive.  Yeah, that one was fudged up.It was also the #1 episode the first time that FX did an all day Viewer\\'s Choice marathon of The X-Files.  I believe the marathon took place on Thanksgiving.And family guyEvery show mentioned in this thread is on HuluHulu isnt a worldwide thingU say that they will go on Hulu but the uk does not have that So maybe they will just go on Netflix or primeBeen years since I watched 24.They can include PG-13 Fox content like the ones mentioned in the survey but I don\\'t see a Fox Banner popping up anytime soon because the brand itself isn\\'t family friendly.Many wouldn’t.Would I need to pay separate for it or will it be part of Disney+So then they should have a 15+ section on disney+ because it’s not like they haven’t made any adult stuff so they are not fully a kid friendly company They are probably 70% kid friendly and 30% adult contentI bet if they add more adult stuff then they will get twice the amount of subscribersThey won\\'t take the Simpsons off since it is already on there without any contractsMy mistake then. What I meant is family guy is the kind of show that\\'s only TV 14 because it\\'s animated. It would never fit the service. The Simpsons is wayy tamerOnly due to the self censoring that it has used. If they took out the bleeps it would be TVMA.Every episode is on there, as well as every episode of all these shows too. (Expect firefly.)Highly recommend getting Hulu.My family\\'s Catholic, so as a kid, my only concept of the word virgin was the \"virgin Mary.\" Nobody ever explained what virgin meant of course, so I just assumed it meant a holy person. The first time I saw *Hocus Pocus* I could not understand what made Max so holy...I don\\'t know, BMW was just the first thing that came to mind. Besides, live-action is probably a better comparison than an animated series.Or The Simpsons Movie which shows Bart\\'s penisThat would be ideal. They could easily go the route of Netflix and simply lock adult content from Kids\\' accounts.Europe does not have Hulu .This is exactly the kind of reddit talk I\\'m talking about. People weren\\'t stuck at home in February when we got subscriber numbersDisney have owned ABC since the mid 90s.Afaik that\\'s actually how Bob Iger ended up at Disney; he was president of ABC before the acquisition.Disney own ABC as wellDisney owns ABC. Google it, its on their Wiki.U saying u would like them shows to be on it I heard they can’t be used those characters for 2-3 yearsUnlikely cause unlike Daredevil these shows aren\\'t TV-MA which Disney+ is againstThose are Netflix shows not Marvel shows.This is a long shot but as someone who watch Brooklyn nine nine on Netflix it was on fox but recently went to nbc I believe could it still be on disney+It is on Hulu, I finished it last week.It’s on Netflix now I think soFamily Guy and American dad are too controversial for Disney+ which is why Bob Iger has said before to not expect them anytime soon.However Bobs Burgers and Futurama have a chanceWhich is only available in the states. These shows either need to be put onto other platforms, or Hulu needs to be made available to other countries.Disney has plans to roll out Hulu internationally. Why do people ignore that? It was announced last year alongside D+Apparently they plan on launching Hulu internationally after d+I live in NZ and we don\\'t have hulu either, I know Disney are planning on launching hulu globally in 2021 though.No Hulu in Canada either, so there\\'s two of their biggest markets gone.See that\\'s fine in the States where your have a Disney plus option to include Hulu but here Hulu ain\\'t available . So trying to compete with other platforms without older content is impossible.And many don\\'t want a bundle with Hulu especially during a time when so many people are laid offIt will be seperate unless Disney does the bundle outside the USThey do have kids profiles so they might take the Netflix approach. However like I said anything beyong TV-14 will not be on Disney+I wasn\\'t sure if that was on Disney+ or notIt already does this, though the children\\'s accounts only show G rated content.Getting yearly subscription is cheaper, on top of which Disney had a sale for market penetration in the beginning and 30 million doesn\\'t even come close to Netflix. They need more original content, and more adult oriented content.Nostalgia will only pay off for so long.They will get 100m in a month or so due to everyone being home from coronavirus threatIt’s only just released in the uk. Everyone is subscribing to entertain their kids in 3 months isolationSince when Could this mean schooled and the Goldberg’s will be on Disney+I have season 1-4 of the Goldberg’s on dvd but the season 5-7 not on dvd in uk and schooled not on dvd in the uk so would love them to be on itSince whenYes, it’s great for kids but at the moment other than the obvious show there’s nothing for adults who love marvel stuff. Daredevil series on Netflix in my opinion was amazing. I would like to see stuff like that added.Disney and Marvel produced them for Netflix and own the rights to the charactersYep. Depending on what the deal is with Netflix for the shows exclusivity or otherwise. Same thing with some of the marvel stuff that\\'s still on Netflix instead of Disney plus.It was produced by NBC so it’ll probably end up on Peacock.NBC produces that show so not likelyWhat I would give for Gene to randomly yell \"Beef Curtains!\" on Disney+.......What about King of the Hill? I don\\'t think it\\'s as bad as Family Guy or American Dad.Got it. Definitely hoping for Bobs BurgersAmen! I live in Canada or I\\'d have Hulu already.Because a show on a service that wont be out till next year shouldnt be used as a, WELL ACKSHUALLY U CAN WATCH ITWait will it be part of the package or not as my family will never get a 4th service We have Netflix, prime and now Disney+ in the uk so I doubt they will get anotherHulu will be rolling out worldwide next year. It includes all TV-MA and Controversial TV-14 Disney IPS. Anything that doesn\\'t fall under those should be added to Disney+ however that does not mean we should add a section for 20th Cenury Fox because they produce R-rated content and they won\\'t have everything from that division and that brand is attached to heavily mature content. So it getting it\\'s own section is highly unlikely.Which is why it’s optional?If they do the bundle and I already have Disney+ would I get Hulu or whatA lot of popular shows on Netflix are 15+In the USA they have the walking dead on it I know the uk one has breaking bad and better call Saul It also has mad men which I think is 15+I look at the most popular list on the Netflix uk app and most are between  pg-13-18+They 100% should have these below on the world wide disney+ (even if I have some on dvd)Modern family (was on Netflix back 2013/14 but is now on prime in uk) Malcom in the middle The Goldberg’s Schooled Glee (it’s on uk Netflix btw)King of the hillThe middle (another popular show) (it’s on prime in the uk)Bobs burgers (it’s on prime in the uk)Futurama (made by same guy who created the Simpsons so no idea why it’s not on yet)Family guy one of the biggest shows on fox but probably never get added American dad was on fox but not anymore and it’s the same reason as family guy24 is one of fox’s biggest shows would be very popular on disney+ but will never get added because it’s 15+~~....wait I could\\'ve sworn it was~~found it it\\'s on thereI didn\\'t realize that, but it does strengthen my point here. They have the infrastructure. There\\'s no reason they can\\'t use it.And select PG contentThey need to bring more fox and abc shows to Disney+ like have a fox section and abc section like they do forDisney Pixar Marvel Star Wars National geographic30m in three months is **insane** man. That\\'s about what Hulu has managed in over a decade. Of course it isn\\'t close to Netflix yet. It just launched in Europe today. It\\'s still growing fast and will come close in far shorter time than expected. They were thinking they\\'d bag 60m by 2024. They\\'re halfway there 3 months in.More original content will come.People keep saying Nostalgia can only last so long but I\\'m not seeing it personally. The remakes still make billions, Old Shows and Movies are still among the most watched stuff on Netflix. It\\'s not like originals aren\\'t on the way. I just don\\'t think the service is in the crisis mode some here paint it to beIt was seeing success before that is what I\\'m talking aboutSince the 90s. 1995 to be exact.Probably not. ABC distributes The Goldbergs but they didn\\'t actually produce it ( Sony did).Basically not all shows that air on ABC were made by ABC. The Goldbergs is one of thoseDisney has owned ABC longer than I\\'ve been alive, and I\\'m 20I don’t know, dude, I don’t work for them. I literally just Googled “ABC wiki” and it says it right there in black and white.Since 1996, boy you sure do not know some stuff as a Disney fan lolI would watch these Some of the Disney movies that I don’t have on dvd I have all marvel movies and Star Wars movies on dvd I would watch clone wars and rebels I would watch the mandalorian again after they are all released Would watch any other live action Star Wars and marvel shows Seen agents of carter but would watch again Would watch runaways but season 3 missing Even Stevens series missing from ukWould watch Simpsons season 20-30 as I have the rest on dvd Seen season 1-4 and up to episode 19 of season 5 of shield so would watch the rest on Disney+ but season 6 is missingSome of the other non-Disney movies I might watch but others I have on dvd And the rest I would not watch or are 50/50 aboutSo it needs more adult friendly shows I would love it if they add more in April to keep us going till marvel and Star Wars release more live action seriesCorrect. Marvel is the producer. Netflix is the distributor. Netflix owns the shows.A lot of the 70s and 80s shows are not on any streaming service in the ukShows like Malcom in the middle game of thrones Boardwalk empire the wire family guy and American dad etc are not on any streaming service in the ukI have all of them on dvdAll the marvel movies apart from hulk and Spider-Man are on disney+ uk but I have all marvel movies on dvd anyway I have all Star Wars movies on dvd (rise of skywalker is out 20th April I still hope it is)But the first 5 seasons was it on fox ?MaybeI Agree;King Of The Hill along with Bob\\'s Burgers are the more Mild Adult shows in adult-oriented Animated TV History; Which are VERY MUCH Unlike Family Guy, Cleveland Show, American Dad, & South ParkIf Hulu drops in Europe then that\\'s all good as we can bunch the package in with D+ like in the US. Just doesn\\'t make sense Disney paying so much for fox and not having a platform to stream the content. Where did you hear about hulu rolling out worldwide from?Yes but the whole reason why Disney is considering adding some of these shows is to keep those exact subscribers who need stuff to watch.Yes but you must get the bundleWell Hulu is only really available in the USA While before the 24th Disney was available in USA Canada, Australia and a few European countries  Now it’s available in a lot more European countries and will be probably available in most European countries by the end of the year They should be in many Asian countries by end of 2020 or early 2021 too Not sure about South America or Africa but they should be same as AsiaThe difference is that if a service feels the same every time you open it then you are more likely to be less interested in itIt’s called hype. Realistically if they don’t add over of ratings soon in a few years I predict a lot less subscribers. It’s adults who pay after allSomeone said they owned abc since the 90sCompletely agree, I’m also quite happy to watch the Spider-Man cartoons for nostalgia reasons lol. But marvel and Star Wars have evolved... blood and violence is part of being a super hero I though that the titans series showed that superblyYes Netflix distributed it but the characters are owned by Disney and the series is also Disney. Netflix just chose to have it on their platformYes but NBC produced the series and owns the rights to it. It\\'s common for outside production companies to produce shows for other networks. Disney also does thisDisney has said many times that Hulu will roll out in other parts of the world in 2021-2022So if I have Disney+ already do I still have to pay another price for the bundle or would I auto get it added to meYeah I know. Not trying to bring down Hulu or anything. Just putting the numbers in perspective.Maybe but it probably won\\'t as time on if they\\'re already contemplating your postYeah.. Hype for **disney** +. It\\'s pretty much exactly what it\\'s advertised to be so real doubt people will start en masse unsubbing for something that knew what they were getting into buying. Like I said reddit is not indicative of the general audience.And R rated stuff is never happening. People here might as well get that out of their heads. Right now, they\\'re simply contemplating adding their ABC/Fox Show slate. It\\'s all pg13Yeah and they have a big slate of shows coming out over the next few years. Marvel Pixar and Lucasfilm all have shows coming by NEXT year ffs[some allegedly this year but we will see now that peoductions shut down]They haveJust hope they add more shows like they mention in the email surveyNever heard that. Ah well guess I\\'ll just have to wait another year so for the full lineup.You pay both all togetherIf they do release Hulu in other parts of the world they should make it part of the Disney+ deal or packageWell that’s a shame, I brought a years subscription and currently I’m happy with the content. But I will not be renewing for my kids to watch moana or frozen for the millionth time... I don’t see how having all the Disney old films to watch when they release maybe 2 a year is worth 60 pound a year with no added content of series for adults. But that’s just my opinion. After a year the kids would have seen 90 percent of the stuff on itWell that math doesn\\'t add up because the 90s we\\'re only like ten years ago.Just looked it up. Was news to me, too: https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/05/disney-aims-to-launch-hulu-internationally-in-2021/No but say I already have one of them such as Disney+ how will it workRumours are they are bringing series like Firefly and Buffy to the service which are far from family friendly imoYes and no.I used to think not but then when I consider the issue that’s still going on with Lizzie McGuire, yes absolutely.Absolutely. There should be a kids option like Netflix, with the full content slate as the default. Why punish the rest of us?Not really? The only thing that annoys me is which shows count as too adult, despite having the same ratings as shows on Disney+.Yes. Very much so. I hope they change this philosophy in the future. Disney needs to grow with the times.No. It was always marketed to be exactly what it is.NoPG-13 horror films that don\\'t rely too much on gore will most likely end up on Disney+ They are also working to fix the adult content situationI don\\'t think so. I like having an app where I can watch something with my family and not worry about awkward scenes. Even though my sister and I are adults, it\\'s awkward to see on screen sex with the parents. Like watching some shows on Apple TV+ was extremely uncomfortable that I don\\'t watch any shows from there with family.Definitely. I was extremely disappointed that they\\'d be excluding a ton of content just to remain \\'family-friendly\\'. Now only is it rude to expect us to pay the same amount of money to them as other services for such limited content, it\\'s just downright annoying to me. I understand they produce family stuff a TON, but even so, why should my viewing pleasure be ruined for a bunch of other people\\'s snotty-nosed kids when the simple solution is just to restrict adult content on the app?Honestly, once my free year with Verizon is up, I\\'m cancelling my account unless they start adding the \\'adult\\' content onto their service, as they should have in the first place.I think so. I could see them adding adult content to Disney+ internationally, but they could not cannibalize Hulu in the USA.Not exactly family friendly when they uncensored Starlord giving Nova Prime the finger and calling himsel a dickLet\\'s be honest, Star Wars and Marvel are far from family friendly.Yeah, I\\'m not a fan of \"Hulu\" and their plans to stretch it out worldwide. I really wish they would have wised up and merged the two.Just because it\\'s always been marketed that way doesn\\'t mean it\\'s a good idea. It just means it wasn\\'t a good idea from the start.That\\'s why services have a kids section so families can watch with less worry. Disney+ isn;t going to last if they hardly update their appHow?Well, I\\'m not watching the kids section on other services as adult with parents.Child separated from single motherMother diesHusband kills wifeFather chops sons hand offSon chops fathers fake hand offSon nearly kills nephew Nephew kills fatherGranddaughter kills grandpaNot serious of course, it’s family friendly irlI\\'m not crying, you\\'re... we\\'re both crying.:(  I can only watch that like once every few years...Note: for US it won\\'t be on Disney+ until may 1st.though for any Americans who want a 90\\'s movie. Cool Runnings is up.I think it will be mid-2020 do June/JulyThey did also say India but tba for that No mention of Middle East or China or Japan etcI hope for an announcement soon! It’s frustraiting enough having to wait until the summer for the release.I expect mid spring or late springIf it\\'s supposed to be Summer 2020, I would think it will be sometime this summer. We just started Spring, so you have at least 3 months to wait, and up to 6 months if it\\'s the end of Summer before you get it.i know right. But aleast it properly wont be delayed because of coronaDont expect anything to be on time right now.The Mandalorian Season 2 and WandaVision maybe will come out on time, since both are done filming (WandaVision more or less as well, even if they may have to film the BIG scene with Doctor Strange to set up his sequel).The Falcon and The Winter Soldier, though, that may be delayed slightly if they can’t get that last week of filming done before the August release deadline.To me, Disney has two options on how to get it done on time for the August release:1. Do editing and VFX for all the footage of the 6 episodes they currently have and then wait until the crisis is somewhat contained to finish that last week of filming in Pinewood in Atlanta.2. Or release the show without the reshoots and just have the audience confront the fear of the virus with the plot of the show dealing with a biological threat, even though the show will end with them stopping the threat.Yep. Pretty much everything is halted right now. I was really disappointed about season four of Fargo myself.Marvel has an app already. It\\'s called marvel unlimited.It all depends on if Disney (or one of it\\'s companies) owns the publishing rights. Some older Star Wars comics, for example, were published by Marvel, but there were other periods that other publishes had the rights to it, and currently, it\\'s IDW Publishing that owns the rights to new Star Wars comics published.For the comics that they do own the rights to, it would be a novel idea to have some of them published, except for Marvel. Marvel has it\\'s own app that they have their comics available on. Why would Disney want to abandon that when it\\'s another line of revenue for them? Sure, they probably don\\'t make as much as they do with D+ overall, but would you want to take a pay cut from your job just because the people paying you wanted you to do more and make less?Ik it does, but don’t you think it’s better to move it to Disney plus, Star Wars comics aswellThanks for the info. I’ve never read a comic from marvel or Star Wars. And I heard they were pretty good that’s why I want them to add a comics section in D+Unlimited (without special promos) costs *more* than Disney+. They\\'d presumably have to at least double the price of Disney+.  Unlimited imo is a very impressive service in it\\'s own right. Being able to read (almost) every marvel (which includes star wars, btw) comic ever is worth it.No, because they will raise the price and people will be paying for something that they don\\'t want. There is already an app for what you want, so pay for it.  Let people pay for what they want.Smart bluray player, current gen gaming console or a Google ChromecastThe cheapest option is probably a blu ray player(Playstation and Xbox also play them) and a Chromecast. It would probably run you 80$ I reckon.Roku systems are cheap and play Disney + and other streaming services..For both Disney+ and BluRay movies, a PS4 pro is probably the best way to go.Your cheapest option is likely to get 2 separate devices. Especially if you are willing to be patient. Amazon Firesticks are really cheap and they’ll discount them heavily on prime day, etc. For Blu Ray, I find you kind of get what you pay for but you can get them pretty cheap at Walmart or Target. There are also probably lots on facebook marketplace for really cheap because a lot of people are just streaming now. That doesn’t get you the “best” option, but it would be the cheapest.Disney Plus is cheaper, but not everything has special features. Then again, not all Blu-Rays have special features either.A smart blu ray player should have the ability to add applications. I suggest one from Sony or Samsung since those app stores typically have Disney plus available.Were you in another country the day before that may be why or it may have thought you were in another country for some reasonOk, logging out and logging in worked.Toggle off your wifi? Ive had a similar issue where D+ wouldnt work on wifi, but ran perfectly on mobile networks. Its a very annoying issue for me1. Where were you yesterday?2. Where are you today?The service you get is the local service, not the location you signed up in or your credit card is billed to. If you sign up somewhere that has the service, then go to somewhere that doesn\\'t have the service, you can\\'t access the service.Or maybe you are in an area that the service just started up in this week. We (in the US) went through this when the service first started - More people trying to access it than the infrastructure could handle. You would think they would learn from that, but maybe not.Uk just got Disney+ so just like when we got it so many people over are trying to watch stuff overloading the server it will happen once more when eastern Europe gets it[removed]I aways get that on ps4Nope, I\\'ve been in America the whole time.So you made a post about a problem before doing the most basic troubleshooting?**Please read this entire message**---> Your comment on r/DisneyPlus was removed due to a Rule 2 violation: \"No posts about piracy or VPNs.\" ---**If you believe this post was removed by mistake, please [contact the Moderators.](https://reddit.com/message/compose/?to=r/disneyplus&subject=Question%20About%20A%20Removal)****Violations may result in a temporary or permanent ban.**So do I, I can’t seem to watch it on PS4Yes, all of Mandalorian is available in the US.Imagineering Story has 6 episodes.We only have the first 2 Mandalorians and 1 episode of the Imagineering story 😟New episodes of The Mandalorian come out weekly until you are caught up.Season 2 of Mandalorian isn’t out until October.All originals air weekly.I\\'m pretty sure 2 episodes will release every friday until they are caught up with the USIf you are bored then just watch something else......What\\'s up?If its not there this week then i can\\'t see it being there down the line.Best investment if you want Disney+ in 4K is a 4k Fire stick.No news. I wouldn’t expect it before July.I\\'m really annoyed it hasn\\'t...Why are people downvoting this!?it\\'s coming out in Summer, I believeThen why is Onward going to be on Disney+ next week when it just came out?Onward has bombed at the box office due to the pandemic and Disney will have lost a lot of money from this film. Loads of people didn’t get the chance to see the movie because the cinemas closed. So Disney is just trying to make the best out of a bad situation by offering it early.Quarantine.They could always release it earlier. But the ones that have been releasing on D+ early have been marketed towards small kids, ie animated films. I\\'d love to be wrong. But I don\\'t think they\\'ll put it on the service early.I’m a 65 inch LG tv. Dolby Vision looked great using the tv appThe UK stream maxes out at 1440p even when it claims to be UHD.Tested quite a bit in developer mode on my 4K Firestick today. Prime and Netflix play UHD resolutions, Disney never ever goes over 1440p.Remember, bandwidth is currently being limited, which is surely part of the issue.Dolby vision looks John Blaze on my Sony.Is that because it’s in letterbox mode for the movies? 2160p would only apply to a movie that’s full screen like some animated movies.But that won’t affect the brightness and colour which is a bigger issue.I made the resolution 4K/SDR on my Apple TV and it seems to have fixed the issue. 4K/HDR was wayyy too dark.Standalone Disney App or on Apple TV? And have to tried limiting to HDR to see if it’s even better?Is that because of the whole covid-19 and downgrading picture quality of streaming sites in the UK during quarantine?I don’t think it’s the BitRate at all. Dropping Dolby vision down to HDR looks infinitely better.Dolby vision looks worse than just SDR imo.Also... people were reporting this issue with Endgame in particular late in 2019.In built tv app on the LG. Have changed any of the settings. The tv detected it as Dolby Vision do didn’t change anything. It looked great. This was last night. Not sure if the are limiting data bandwidth during the day.I don\\'t think so. Netflix and Prime still have a UHD stream even with the bitrate reduction.It is because of this Disney confirmed so. 4K will not work until a later date.Hmmmmm... I’ll try the built in app. I have a 2016 LG OLED so hopefully it’s got one.[This article](https://www.looper.com/177455/avengers-endgame-looks-drastically-worse-on-disney/) is showing the same thing I can see, especially on the image with 4 different screenshots comparing Disney plus and disc.I don’t think it’s a bit rate issue as that should cause some compression and not affect the colour and brightness.Interesting. I’ll have a look later after work.It’s usually always between 3 and 4 am in your time zone. Sometimes not until 5am. Late enough to not stay up for it basically. It will be waiting for you in the morning :)U.K. get two episodes of Clone Wars tomorrow and next Friday dude.Thanks my manThanks what about the week after next week will it just continue or just show one episode per FridayWe get two episodes of Clone Wars this friday. Next Friday and Friday after that so it lines us up with the US people in time for siege of MandaloreAre you sure Simpsons is fixed? I thought that came from an incorrect article that was posted here?Simpsons isn\\'t fixed in the UKSimpsons isn\\'t fixed in the UKWhere did you get the \"The Simpsons is fixed\" thing from?I didn\\'t know they fixed the Simpsons, that\\'s good news.As for your concern, I\\'m sure they will in time. D+ is still relatively new. It seems like they just threw content up just to have content and figured they would fix it later.Yes, they do. Sadly they are moving slowly and with the Covid19 stuff i\\'d say now we\\'re looking at late 2020 instead of \"early 2020.\"I read another thread here that said it had been.they didn\\'t fix it. that article was written by someone who doesn\\'t do any research. it\\'s STILL not fixed in America.they didn\\'t fix it. that article was written by someone who doesn\\'t do any research. it\\'s STILL not fixed in America.This is to keep the conversation going. If they release it all at once people will forget about it and also maybe even unsubscribeThey\\'re releasing it weekly so that when season 2 airs weekly you won\\'t be disappointed. If they dropped all of season 1 at once you might expect all of season 2 at once; this way you know what to expectIt makes me wonder... when Season 2 is out, do we have to wait another 4 months for that to come out here?And there you have it. ALSO the idea that most people will just pirate the show beforehand due to limited release is wrong. Some people pirate stuff, most people have no idea how to pirate stuff and where to go.No. You guys will get it the same time as everyone else. The only reason why you got it late now was because you guys got the service lateI would like to know if we have the option to choose if we want to watch something dubbed or not.I grew up with a lot of the old Disney animated movies dubbed to Norwegian, watching them in any other language would be weird. But at the same time, most of the newer animated movies, like Frozen, I prefer to watch in English.And I would like the option to watch live-action movies in English. The only exception might be the two «The Incredible Journey» movies from the 90’s.Yes. In Germany and they are available in lots of languages and also with lots of subtitles. In Germany everything can be put in German.In Germany you can.Thanks :)Would be weird if they didnt have it since disney dubbes almost everythingDo people don’t binge it during the 7 day trial, then bail.............Ahhh yeah true never thought of it like that. I see myself keeping it along with Netflix and Prime videoSkip them manually.All shows seem to have that.That\\'s how I learned to read.I quite like Netflix 10 second countdown then proceeds to next episodeIn [ ]:There was a post yesterday that said they fixed it. (US)https://i.redd.it/9xjib6zi6vo41.jpgWith the virus outbreak it’s unlikely at the moment please just watch it if you wantIt’s not fixedDo you know if Chip & Dale Rescue Rangers, The Little Mermaid TV show and Goof Troop were fixed too?You are right and it seems they are not going to fix it.I\\'m not sure, but I think they have no reason to fix it. When Simpsons was chopped they chopped some jokes, that\\'s the reason why people are complaining.They DO have a reason to fix it, it\\'s because 1/3 of the screen is chopped off!More viewers are more concerned with \"it doesn\\'t fill up my whole screen\" than care about original aspect ratio, especially with children\\'s programing (though I fall into the original aspect ratio category). Despite the vocal minority on the Simpsons (you\\'ll see most posts are by the same few people), most subscribers don\\'t care either way, and some *want* it 16:9. The holdup with the Simpsons is they are trying to add an *alternate* video feed for the 4:3 versions, something the old Simpsons World app used to do in the U.S. (though it was eventually buried deep in the settings because few people used it). The service is 5 months old, it isn\\'t perfect. It has major security flaws, UX flaws, and delivery flaws and those offer a greater return on investment (ROI) for resources. When they have widespread hacking and no ability for users to manage fraudulent users and devices abuse, then updating already available content falls down the list of priorities. And, yes, The Simpsons have a significantly higher ROI than those Disney series.Okay, my point was that Simpsons is way more popular than these shows and I don\\'t think they focus on fixing these shows. Also they have other problems just give them time and enjoy other shows if they are available.Well the people who would rather have 1/3 cut off shouldn\\'t be the main audience anyway. It\\'s an insult to the creators of those animated shows to have so much of the screen cropped. If kept only for ignorance\\'s sake, then how am I or anyone who loves animation, meant to take Disney+ seriously? This is something I would expect of TV channels, which typically don\\'t have a decent way to give feedback. Disney+ and other streaming services shouldn\\'t stoop to such lows. At the very least have a disclaimer stating that the original (non-cropped) aspect ratio is kept to preserve each show\\'s original image quality. I also understand some shows like Kim Possible, The Emperor\\'s New School and Lilo and Stitch TAS are in widescreen too, but they were made for that format and cropped in their initial TV runs.So then that\\'s just a double standard. Only seeing an issue with 1/3 of the screen being chopped off for one show and not others is so hypocritical. You\\'re literally saying that The Simpsons is more important than Disney\\'s own original shows.Yes, that\\'s what I\\'m saying and you are right.  It\\'s all about money, I would guess a lot of people are subscribing for the Simpsons. I\\'m not you are wrong, I\\'m saying they have other priorities.First day at 5m is a lot. The downloads to subscribers number is going to be a lot closer on day 1 and the early days in general.I remember the Nov launch had 3.5m downloads and we ended up with 10m subscribers. Not saying extrapolation will be the same but it will be closeStarted Clone Wars for the first time. Has made me fall in love with Star Wars again I must say.It literally could not have been timed better. The country was put on lockdown on Monday night and D+ dropped on Tuesday.Yet no full season of Mandalorian...Interesting to see trial rate, pay rate, 1-month retention too. But of course, that won\\'t be disclosed.Disappointing- no full season of Mandalorian or Clone Wars S7. The service is useless to me.Same here, very much enjoying it so far.Yeah, there\\'s no way they\\'d put the full season on there otherwise people would use the 7 day trial to watch it and then cancel.And no even Stevens seriesDid you really expect them to do it differently to how they launched in the US? Besides when it comes to season 2, we\\'ll all be getting it weekly.There\\'s a lot more on Disney+ than Star Wars.There is million of series that aren\\'t Star Wars.But would they not use the 7 days trial after the season is outThat\\'s a good point but then, people and having patience...Disney are relying on that not happening.Alot of North American people actually finished Mandlorian then unsubscribe from D+ now subbed for clone wars then are going to do it again until season 2.That’s cool and all but I really need them to fix the aspect ratio for The SimpsonsYes, the one person that runs Disney+ has made a small upgrade!Is it just me or does the Disney+ UI only seem marginally better than the Amazon Prime UI, which I consider the worst UI?Here\\'s to hoping one day Disney will hire that second admin...Edit: UI not OINothing changed.... the sidebar has always been on top and there\\'s always been a dropdown menu when you hover over your profile picture.The only feature I really want is to be able to add individual episodes and movies to playlists. It\\'s a feature that none of the streaming services have.None of the things you listed, except for logging out devices/device management, needed to be day one features.  More features = later release.But it still blows my mind that you can\\'t log out devices.  It\\'s inexcusable.A to Z annoys me personally where some are listed as Disneys ________instead of tweaking the UI the devs shoudl focus on getting proper dolby atmos support across all devices or at least provide a official supportartikel that lists all devices with atmos support.Or literally anything anyone has been asking for besides a pointless facelift.I\\'m not about to call the D+ interface brilliant but it\\'s still far better than the UK version of Prime. That has paid content mixed with free, seasons separated as individual shows and 4K separated from HD. Disney Plus is a little basic (though it\\'s very responsive for me) while Amazon Prime Video is an absolute mess.Hulu is worseAlso what’s OI? Don’t you mean UI?Netflix has always been the worst imo. Endless horizontal scrolling and no semblance of organization whatsoever. The categories are in a different order every time you open the app. Everything is designed to give the illusion of a massive, never ending library but all it does is frustrate the user and make it harder to find things. All streaming services should have significantly expanded filter options and the ability to create a personal library with customizable folders and sorting so people can keep track of things the way that makes the most sense to them.Primes ui is horrible[deleted]And get their shows all in the right order. Phineas and Ferb has been out of order for at least 4mo according to Reddit and it\\'s driving me insaneCompletely agree, Amazon Prime in the UK is just so clumsy. So far D+ is a huge improvement IMO.Yeah I hate Hulu.Who thought it was a good idea to put the bar there.  It just seems hard to navigate.I feel like no one really browses hulu though, they just pick what they want.Try using Pluto tv sometime.  There’s no search bar.#HULU IS WORSEFTFYOperating Interface, if I\\'m to guess.I always considered the Netflix UI the gold standard, but to each their own. Filters would be nice, though.> Everything is designed to give the illusion of a massive, never ending libraryIf that were the case, there wouldn\\'t be the same 3 shows I never want to watch on 3 different lines.I\\'ve been using Disney+ since September (Dutch beta test) and I\\'ve never seen the web version look any different than it is now. Neither have I seen anyone else\\'s web version look any different..It\\'s driving me mad too.... They\\'ve bundled together episodes from all over the place too. Proper episode one (Rollercoaster) is bundled with episode 7 (Candace looses her head) do you can\\'t even try to watch them in order... Seriously FCUKed up....OG DuckTales is also apparently scrambled for whatever reason. 🤔The X-Men cartoon has the freaking Phoenix saga out of order.  And the parts are labeled 1 to 5.What about the irritating advertisement bug on Hulu where the content starts and then the ad resets the content after like 5 seconds?Honestly, I don\\'t browse any of the streaming services. I always pick what I want. The crap they recommend is hit or miss, so I just stick with the critically acclaimed shows that I hear of from elsewhere.CAN you even browse through Hulu?Pluto tv is for two things James Bond and Doctor WhoWhat would be nice would be a kickbutt world-class recommendation algorithm, one that knows what you already like and therefore would like.Now I wonder where they could find such a thing?  Maybe look in the Marketing Department\\'s shredder?The world is dealing with a pandemic, and you’re upset about Phineas and Ferb lolI pay for the ad free version so I haven\\'t seen this issue.Yep. The only streaming services I browse are Netflix and Disney+. I only watched Hulu for the Nicktoons, Cartoon Network shows, and Boy Meets World really.It has Doctor Who?  I was using it for Bajillion dollar Properties.And Spongebob if it’s actually on.Better to be upset about something this petty than out stabbing the idiots who are having a barbeque with 30 odd people in their garden a street up from us.....Also, they need an easy way to jump back to the top of the screen. Sometime I\\'ll be scrolling down for a bit and want to get back to the top...in some other platforms you just need to hit the back button to do this. For D+ you have to actually scroll back up to the top.I agreeAs someone who sometimes watches netflix while browsing something, the lack if a mini player is so dissapointing. Hopefully itll be added soonI agreeI hate that I can\\'t open an episode list or go to the shows page from the continue watching sectionI wish I could search episodes of shows instead of scrolling back and fourth.Most movies have a trailer under the extras section.I would love a your favorites section for the stuff my son watched over and over and over and overAgreed. And if like to see the runtime before starting it.And a back button, for some reason there isn\\'t one? And I have to click the browser\\'s back button which feels weird as I\\'m constantly scared it\\'ll leave the websiteI think this is actually offeredIn [ ]:On the UK app, no. Best to consult the wiki when watching to be safeI only noticed one episode was out of order. That’s assuming the episodes are numbered correctly...alright, thanks!Think this is it :)  [https://disneytermsofuse.com/english/](https://disneytermsofuse.com/english/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/Wolentec/comments/fpd0h5/didnt\\\\_fit\\\\_in\\\\_message/?utm\\\\_source=share&utm\\\\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wolentec/comments/fpd0h5/didnt_fit_in_message/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) a copy of the email you getthankyou!How does that “seem strange”? Most movies are available to be purchased for a time before they are put on a streaming service unless they are made exclusively for that service. But this is a regular theatrically released film. Normal timeline is this:A film hits a theaters and has a 2-3 month run. A film is available for purchase for 3-4 months.Then the film hits streaming services about 6-8 months after it initially hits theaters and has had both a successful theatrical and home sales run.Cause they want to make as much money as possible on digital and bluray sales first before it’s on Disney+. Frozen 2 and Onward being on it are a unique situation.Not strange at all. Films hit theaters for about 2-3 months usually, then when it hits home media (digital HD and later 4K/Bluray/DVD) it\\'ll be available for rent and purchase. Finally, roughly 6-8 months (Disney is usually around 7) after hitting theaters it will hit streaming services like Netflix, Hulu or Disney+. The fact that *Frozen II* and *Onward* were/will be added so soon is strange and an anomaly due to the COVID-19 pandemic.I\\'m with you. Everybody is saying they want to make money, but I thought this is how it\\'s going to works.That is how it normally worksOnce it leaves theatres, it becomes available for purchase.first digital only where you pay $20+ for only the digital copy, this lasts typically for 2 weeks.And then the physical release comes out which comes with Discs (DVD, Blu-ray, 4K) and a digital copy code. For usually $5-10 more than the digital only version.This is when you can finally start to rent the movie too for about $5.99 digitally or physically from a Redbox, movie rental store, or library.Sometimes the physical rental release might take a few days to be available for Disney movies though, at least on Redbox from what I\\'ve seen before.And then a few months after that, it finally hits streaming.This is all for maximum profit, first a one time theatrical viewing, and then if you want to watch again at home you pay the maximum price for digital only, or wait a few weeks to get the physical copy with a digital code, or pay a smaller fee to rent for only 48 hoursand then finally after they\\'ve made their millions on all of that they\\'ll finally add it to their $6.99/mo service. They\\'ve made some exceptions recently with Frozen 2 and Onward because of the current situation, moving them up to Disney+ earlier, but you\\'ll see that movies like Star Wars is in no way being offered that treatment because they know fans will pay for it to watch elsewhere.I guess I was just hoping that in the current situation we all are facing they would have offered the movie on the app simultaneously.It doesn’t seem fair to me that Star Wars 9 isn’t on Disney Plus yet. It came out 3 months before Onward and 1 month after Frozen 2!Frozen had a month of being available for purchase, onward\\'s theatrical release got cut off short, and those are the more family friendly animated movies, so Disney offered them earlier as an exception during this time. I don\\'t see them adding Star Wars, a popular franchise that had its whole theatrical run already, but hasn\\'t been on home media for 2 weeks yet, with the physical release not even out yet to Disney+ when they know fans desperate enough to watch it now can pay the $20 to buy it digitally, or wait a week to rent or buy the physical release. Disney did not price their service at only $6.99/mo to add movies to it as soon as they come out of theatres. Maybe if they raise the price they may movie releases to Disney+ sooner, but they\\'ll still have a home media sales period to make maximum profit on each movie first.Disney had no obligation to release *Frozen II* or *Onward* early on the service. They added *Frozen II* three months early as a gift to customers dealing with the quarantine and likely led to some new subscriptions. *Onward* was added because its run barely started at the theater when they were all shut down so rather than lose money they can sell it digitally and maybe get some new subscriptions. *Episode IX* grossed over a billion dollars at the box office and will be released on Disney+ in October, the original timeline given.Disney+ is available on Roku. I have it downloaded on mine. You might have to search for it under \"Add Channels\" (or something along those lines).I have multiple Roku Express boxes and a Roku 3. It’s there.Disney+ is available on Roku. You can find the list of [supported Roku devices here](https://help.disneyplus.com/csp?id=csp_article_content&sys_kb_id=a168b614db4d40d03c0cf158bf96198e):In [ ]:I believe only options through app are monthly and annual plan, it might have mentioned the bundle but then it would direct you to the site to complete the transaction because the bundle doesn’t do free trials, you just pay for it immediately and it doesn’t support 3rd party billing like through iTunes or google play.Every month content releases on specific days. It’s all on YouTube if you want to see the details but you would need to see videos within your country since every country puts out different content every month.TBH, I think Disney should give ETA on shows and not just new movies.Original series are always released on Fridays. Other random library content is added throughout the week, if there is any.Wait so if say a fox tv show that comes to Disney might not be on the uk version Just like the walking dead is on Netflix USA but not ukBut I would rather the Disney+ website told me what was new/coming soon instead of going to Youtube to find out.Yes just like thatKyle Reese aka Corporal Hicks aka Johnny RingoI just met him last month. Was a really cool guy and I\\'m glad that he\\'ll be in the spotlight again. Love him as an actor!Hope he\\'s in better shape than in recent years.Unrelated but this is bugging me, I feel like I saw him referenced as joke on a tv show.....but I can\\'t remember which. Any chance someone could help me  out with that?I really like him as an action movie actor.  I think he will fit well in here maybe as a bounty hunter or mob boss.Will he play a navy seal? Because he always doesBring on the Blood Dragons!Sergeant Rex Power Colt.Boba Fett? BOBA FETT?! WHERE?!NiceYay!HOLY FACK YES!!!Thrawn?I thought season 2 was already done filming?>officially cast>RumorBruhFor one episode most likely.so they haven\\'t even started filming it yet, but its coming in October? Thats so much faster then Netflix!I\\'m your Huckleberry...  Edit: Thanksaka  Lt. CoffeyFitting that one of the best modern western movie villains has been cast in a space western.Cut him some slack. Dude\\'s been fighting Terminators and Aliens. It takes its toll.He is going to play luke SkywalkerI know a couple years ago he was pretty builtThe Adam Carolla Show/podcast maybe? I don’t listen anymore but Bald Bryan on that show is a big Michael B. fan and it got brought up on the show a lot. Michael’s kid even became an intern/worker on the showI remember him most from Navy Seals, Terminator and The Rock. I was so upset when they killed him off in the first 30 minutes of The Rock.In my mind, the man behind the Boba Fett mask is and will forever be Jett Li.It is not uncommon after filming is done to announce people who were cast in the show.They finished filming about a month ago.Casting news getting out after filming has ended is pretty commonFilming is already done...Great, now I\\'ll be disappointed if we don\\'t get space Doc Holliday.\"He\\'s so drunk, he\\'s probably seeing double\"\"I got two lightsabers, one for each of ya\"*I’m your HuckleberryI don’t see itHmmmmmmmm......I didn\\'t know that, very cool!LOL.Would be cool to see him being someone like that...Holy crap, how did I type it like that... yikes.Thanks for the catch.Just trolling...he will probably play an imp or a bounty hunterYou look like somebody just walked over your grave!No problem. I’m going to have to buy it again now since I don’t know what happened to my dvd.Omg I don’t remember commenting that how did I think that was real 😭Gotta hate it when that happens but now you can have it in HD! or UHD even! :PGreat movie.Yep! Got it for $8 off of iTunes.Niiiiiice.Nows a perfect time to look through their expansive catalog and add some new contentThe money being lost from the closure of their theme parks and resorts totally eclipses any extra money Disney+ is making from everybody being stuck at home.I\\'m certainly using it to watch old childhood favoritesNow is a good time to add more content such as shows from fox and abcYou\\'re right but all these people will probably remain on Disney+ even after coronavirus is overInteresting to see how this impacts subscription rates as disposable income is affected by the pandemic. Will they cut prices?This is false. For America it hasn’t been fixed unfortunately and it wouldn’t be a smart move for only America to have the original aspect ratioApparently, this publication doesn\\'t do their due diligence and fact check their articles. Makes me wonder what else they may have got wrong in other stories.Oh I know. And I have heard this from people who do use this in the US so i have found out.Basically it just shows how people in the UK refused to watch the early episodes in it\\'s cropped versions.In good old British swearings.Wait you\\'ve heard from some people that the Original Aspect Ratio was fixed?No. Someone told about the aspect ratio is still not right despite what this website has saidTo be fair I\\'m fine with both a reboot or a season 3. The original show had a rather definitive conclusion, so maybe a reboot is the way.I mean if it was rebooted, we could have season 1 without the weird slang.There was also a version 1.33 this morning. I don\\'t know what\\'s in that either.[deleted]Why wouldn’t anyone wanna know what’s in a update?Because sometimes when software you pay for gets changed, you want to know what\\'s different, in case it influences your decision to pay.[deleted]1. Semantics. I pay for the service that is only available through the software; thus, a change in the software impacts the service.2. Version 1.32 is the update that was installed when I turned on my PS4 to watch Empire Strikes Back with my girlfriend 2 hours ago. I can\\'t wait to find out what Vader had to say about Luke\\'s father when it finishes buffering in 20 minutes. If only I had some idea of whether the buffering was due to server issues, the new patch, or something else, because Netflix on the same console doesn\\'t have this issue.app version depends on the platform.  not all are on 1.4.1My perception is that 90% of the people with problems in this sub are using a PS4.So, it\\'s a Disney+PS4 problem most likely.Avenir-Roman and Avenir-HeavyWhere specify? Looking in inspect element in chrome I found that the button on the preview screen says  font-family: Avenir-Light, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; but then again I still don\\'t have access to Disney plus in my countrySame thing with frozen 2What region are you in? Can confirm that this is not true for me in US. (Although it is true for the Dumbo movie but that\\'s a known issue)Cars 3 is only found in normal profiles - not kids profilesIt also needs be very precise, searching for \"Mrs Doubtfire\" bring back no results, but \"Mrs. Doubtfire\" does.  I had to search \"Robin Williams\" to get it to show upI have episodes appearing and disappearing depending on how I access themSome of the shows in the US aren\\'t in the UK/Ireland like Amphibia, The Proud Family, Big City Greens and some of the recent seasons of Ducktales, Star Vs the Forces of Evil, Milo Murphy\\'s Law.It has been happening since I first signed up for it. I just search for it and then watch it.The UI is sloppy. Movies are not in there number order for example.Lack of content when they could do things like have all the various versions of same Starwars movie, original Vs enhanced. They should be displayed in release order or sort by cronalodgicalIt\\'s because those movies aren\\'t actually streamable. They show a date from when you\\'ll be able to watch them when you select them. Disney only shows movies you can watch unless you search for them and want to know when you\\'ll be able to watch them.\"The Simpsons Movie\" is listed as \"Simpsons Movie\". If you search \"The Simpsons\" it doesnt show. This UI has problems.I knowEurope, to be precise Austria.Cause it’s PG... I think they should have a better filter on thatHappens for me with Mandalorian.That’s true for Toy Story 4 but not for Gummy Bears that was as well hidden until I searched for it.Can confirmIf I go to search -> tv shows -> animation -> it is shownThe fact that I’m from Austria?It wasn’t there for me until I used the search function. Neither under Animation nor TV shows all.Yeah. Jks aside... I mean the problem. I can confirm, that the problem exist.Although it is possible to watch Disney Plus on an iPad without the app, you do need the right version of video player. Unfortunately, iOS 11 is too old to support that. Also, the demanding resolution and stream decoding might require a more capable device.In other words, if the iPad doesn\\'t work with iPadOS 13, Disney Plus _probably_ won\\'t play on it.Have you tried updating to IOS 13?Unfortunately, there is no other way of watching DisneyPlus on iOS devices other than the app. Streaming via the website is only available on a desktop with certain system requirements. See this page for all detailed information: [DisneyPlus Help Center](https://help.disneyplus.com/csp?id=csp_article_content&sys_kb_id=d2b91d6bdb3048900a2af56e0f96197f).**note**: the app description says that it requires iOS 11 or higher. This could either be a mistake, or the device is simply incompatible/underpowered to use Disney Plus.I can confirm that it will play on my iOS 12 iPad on the iOS app.Thank you for this, it’s annoying that I have to look at this post rather than just Disney+ having the correct order. I really hope it gets fixed soon.We’ve been havin’ the same problem here in the States. My advice is to hop on here and nag the hell outta them.[https://help.disneyplus.com/csp](https://help.disneyplus.com/csp)Hope they fix it all for the simpsons & phineas and ferbWhy the heck are they out of order?? I was watching ducktales thinking first episodes were missingEdit: region Europe, state ItalyWhen you say \"Listed in the correct order on Disney+\", is this for the US? Only asking because **X-Men TAS** only appears to be in the correct order for Season 2 here in the UK. Even Season 1 has some in the wrong order. Not a huge issue for me, but would be nice to just press play rather than browse through the episode list.The Simpsons are in order though.Yes, I mean for the US. To make sure I\\'d look at the order my list is in and see if it\\'s the same as on Disney+. Though I could have sworn the UK version was in order too.So sorry my bad hope aspect rasio gets fixed phineas an ferb are abit out of order 😀Season 1 is for the most part, but The Cure and Come the Apocalypse appear before the The Unstoppable Juggernaut. Found it a bit strange, especially due to the story arc.I saw Phineas and Ferb and it looks like all episodes were mixed in a blender instead of in a coherent order.On DisneyLife they were in order now there out hope they all get fixed in update at least x men animated has the 1st 2 seasons in orders as they used to be out of order 😀In the 1940s, when Fantasia was made, movies put all their credits at the beginning for some reason. I don’t know why.LOOOOOOOOL. TCM would blow this guy’s mind.Disney Animated Films didn\\'t start having credits at the end of the film until The Black Cauldron in 1985.Fantasia isn\\'t supposed to have end credits. It was made in 1940, fer Pete\\'s sake.They did create end credits for a home video release in the early 90\\'s. But they weren\\'t part of the original theatrical release, and they haven\\'t been included in subsequent releases.They did this because the directors, producers, actors etc felt it necessary to list who made/was in the film to inform the audience. Maybe cuz of no trailers back then? I believe George Lucas was first to buck the trend with Star Wars and he got a lot of backlash for it. I read it in Bob Igor’s book.Ya, literally every movie... \"no credits\"&#x200B;:PWait isn\\'t tcm the warner movies tv channel that cut off every single time end credits?What\\'s TCMokWeirdly aggressive answer😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂ok who\\'s tcm LOLTCM stands for Turner Classic Movies.Of the Disney movies that I\\'ve seen: Home on the Range.According to Letterboxd, the bottom 5 from “least worst” to “worst” are:5. G-Force4. Super Buddies3. George of the Jungle 22. Kazaam1. Inspector Gadget 2I grew up with the 2 Inspector Gadgets but haven’t seen them in years. I’d like to, for the laughs.Edit: FormattingWhy pick one when you have a whole category. DCOMs 😂I was part of the generation they targeted them at and even back then I knew how bad they were when I watched a real movie after them.Fuzzbucket.I\\'m sure there are worse, more obscure movies, and the straight to video sequels are pretty mediocre, but The Country Bears or Kazaam are both famously riff-able.The Wild*The Muppets* (2011; PG)I **love** the Muppets. I\\'m a huge Jim Henson fan. I don\\'t think Disney did a good job with that film. It\\'s an okay movie, but it\\'s not a very good Muppet movie.Frozen 2.I welcome your downvotes!>!Avatar!<In all seriousness though there are some stinkers I would never even try to watch based just on reviews. They are mostly made for TV movies.The winner according to IMDB is *Freaky Friday*, the 2018 tv movie at 3.7, 22% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes oddly enough it is 67% with critics, shrug.Some other notable mentions*The Poof Point*  4.7 IMDB*Super Buddies* 4.3 IMDB*College Road Trip* 4.3 IMDB, 36 Metacritic, 12% Critic Rating 50% audience rating on rotten tomatoes.&#x200B;People also deeply despise *A Wrinkle in Time*. I personally find it more watchable than a lot of well regarded movies.Cinderella 3. Hands down.Invisible Sister is pretty direThe Rocketeer hasn\\'t aged well, I watched last night, its cheesier than I rememberDepends, have they put Rise of Skywalker up yet?The phantom menace and attack of the clones are actually abysmal, why people like those 2 I will never understandThe Last JediPutting a \"buddies\" movie in your list hurtsHow *dare* you put Kazaam on the list!Kazaam is still one my guilty pleasure movies. It’s so ridiculously weird and dumb but I can’t help but enjoy that part of itNot the worst movie but it is a really terrible movie that is in par with the phantom menace’s reaction. People liked it cause hey it’s more of this thing I love. Then a few weeks pass and then can’t deny how bad it really was.I didn’t like either movie much but the second one literally has no memorable moments because none of the characters actually did anything. They just threw them in the woods and played music over them talking. It was like watching kids play with the dolls and calling it a million dollar movie which I would’ve been more ok with because at least that would’ve been adorable and make sense!Prekwel badMemes is the answerI feel asleep through Attack of the Clones. At least ROTS is way better. lolThat is so far from being the worstHey, when Letterboxd speaks it speaks ([link](https://letterboxd.com/smd2006/list/every-movie-on-disney-plus/by/rating-lowest/))There are good aspects of the movies but they are not worth sitting through the rest of the garbageKeep telling yourself thatHahahah and the sequels are much better right?7 and 8 are good movies, far from perfect but are very enjoyable 8 has the terrible b plot which really brings it down episode 9 is not great still far better than episodes 1 and 2I’m sure it has nothing to do with this little corona virus going around...This is because of Coronavirus, don’t expect this to be the strategy in the long-term.I wish they\\'d show the same courtesy outside of the US, but I\\'m sure it\\'s just Sky stopping them in the UK.Tros is still expected to arrive in July at the momentI would not expect this to be the new norm. We are in extraordinary times, and extraordinary reactions will be happening. When life gets back to normal, I fully expect Disney, and other movie companies, will return to normal operations as they had done before, especially with big blockbuster films.Who knows in the future maybe this can be a technique of there’s but I highly doubt it. This is only happening due to COVID-19. Plus the DVD of Onward actually came out first by a 2 weeks before Onward coming on Disney+.It\\'s due to the COVID-19 pandemic. I wouldn\\'t expect it to be a norm. They\\'d lose a lot of money doing this.I mean you’re rightYeah, I was hoping we’d get Frozen 2 soon (for my daughter to watch, obviously *cough*), but the app says mid-July. I bet Onward be after that.We already had the blu ray pre ordered before all of this, so it\\'s not the end of the world.  I\\'m more about star wars as I never got to see that in the cinema and I bet they release it on d+ months earlier in the US.Seeing Oprah, Mindy, and Reese gets me so hyped to watch this.I love this movie. Excellent visual effects.My favorite book that got me into reading once again butchered by execs that wanted press before a movie, narrative, character, appeal, coherency, and virtually anything remotely enjoyable. But hey, our cast is diverse! Diversity means making posters that feature people that aren’t white right! High five Disney! Thanks Disney!I’m sorry if you or anybody enjoyed this but between this and the tv one from a decade or two ago, there is just nothing about these that doesn’t scream bad movie. I genuinely love the story but Disney shouldn’t be the ones making the movieDoes it have to be? /sDoes it actually output Atmos though? Here in the EU (and UK) it says the titles have Atmos on my AppleTV 4K and FireTV Cube Gen2 but it actually only plays DD5.1So I\\'ve tried this but while it shows that it\\'s Atmos, it most certainly isn\\'t actual Atmos sound. Everything is front focussed with no height which is basically what happens when the Xbox tries to output Atmos with just a 5.1 source. It misinterprets where the rears should go and sends them to the front surrounds.Hopefully they\\'ll fix  it soon if their intention is to enable the Xbox for Atmos.Did you get a recent update? I have the X and still only see 5.1 for the Disney+ app. I have a full ATMOS setup and the atmos enabled.... I’ve been hoping for this to come through...Edit: yup it’s working now. Had to go into my settings and turn on 7.1 then re-enable atmos and it’s appearing now! So going to annoy my wife with movies now!Supported includes:Star Wars titles, Marvel titles, Pixar titles, as far as I’m aware.  I’m sure other Disney titles are supported now as well, however titles in HDR10 still only support 5.1 surround sound.Of course you must have a 4K tv, and a supported AV receiver/soundbar for Dolby Atmos/Vision passthrough to properly work w/ the XB1X.That\\'s awesome, even though I don\\'t own an XboxYay, thanks for posting this!Hi there, my Soundbar (VIZIO) flashes green when Dolby Atmos/Vision is actively passing through/up-mixing.  To the middle-left (where the movie description is) the details use to read Dolby Vision, but with 5.1.  I opened Disney+ today and noticed Atmos replaced the 5.1 audio details.  As far as I’m aware, it should output Dolby Atmos ([VIZIO SmartCast app](https://imgur.com/gallery/Y6VTUJS)) with Netflix & Disney+, however the format is not lossless, and the audio is compressed in passthrough due to the limitations of HDMI 1.4 or 2.0a/b protocols with a max of ~10.5GB/s of data throughput (HDMI 1.4), and ~18.5GB/s (HDMI 2.0a/b).The new protocol HDMI 2.1 coming out for many Smart TV’s/soundbars this year is exciting news as the theoretical data transfer rate is ~48GB/s thus making the passthrough of this information lossless, or uncompressed.I find myself constantly factory resetting my soundbar because of HDCP 2.2 errors after turning off my devices for extended hours (a day at work). Meaning I often can’t stream Dolby Atmos titles via Netflix or play BluRays without resetting.  It’s a minor inconvenience, but it does get annoying doing this so often.Is your ATV properly configured? Do you have Atmos enabled under Immersive Audio?Edit: never mind. The EU is being throttled at the moment. There’s probably no 4K either.I’ve see. This with my Xbox as well. No rear sound when sound settings are in Dolby Atmos but when it’s set to dts the rear sound works fine.how does it sound? notice any difference, besides noted in previous posts, of before and after update? my current living situation only allows \"dobly atmos for headphones\" so i\\'m curious if this update would warrant signing up (already demo\\'d the 7 day free trial pre-pandemic) as my x1x has been my primary streaming box during lockdown due to the \"atmos for headphones\" capabilities.would be nice to have another source for atmos headphone listening besides netflix and vudu.It would be a lot more awesome if you actually allowed us to use Atmos in the EU and UK. The \"bandwidth restrictions\" thing just doesn\\'t float since Atmos adds almost nothing to the Streaming bitrate...😬Confirmed working on xbox one sYes. I have been using Atmos daily on iTunes and Netflix. It works on my AppleTV and my FireTV Cube. Disney has turned off Atmos in Europe, they claim to save bandwidth during the Corona crisis, but I have my doubts.DD+ and DD+Atmos is roughly 200Kbit\\'s difference in bitrate, and I really don\\'t think that is enough to \"break the Internet\"...🤦The Xbox has a bug where, if you set the sound output to Atmos but it\\'s only a 5.1 source, it will incorrectly map the rear surround channels to the front. If you try a genuine Atmos or 7.1 source you won\\'t have that issue so Disney plus is obviously only streaming 5.1 DD+ in the UK, even where it says Atmos.From the looks of it Disney+ is needlessly capping bitrate, resolution and restricting Atmos playback in Europe at the moment which is why the Xbox isn\\'t giving out true Atmos even when it\\'s indicated the content has it. Great work on ruining the launch over here in the UK Disney!DD+ is usually either 384 or 640 kbps with and without Atmos. The Atmos metadata is tiny. The actual sound you hear is DD+. DD+ can have much higher bitrates up to 3 Mbit/s but in practice they’re never that high. Netflix now has 640 kbps DD+. They upgraded their audio this past summer. Atmos is simply metadata that positions the sound in xyz coordinates.I know. That\\'s why I said it won\\'t add much in terms of bitrate. Netflix with Atmos is up to 640kbit/s and without is a bit less. It\\'s negligible.Not sure but I just had an update on Android to version 1.4.1Version 1.33 this morning!It\\'s not on the list of supported devices. I think someone jumped the gun and put it on the list here (which is unofficial). [https://help.disneyplus.com/csp?id=csp\\\\_article\\\\_content\\\\_international&sys\\\\_kb\\\\_id=eac89167db3048900a2af56e0f96193b](https://help.disneyplus.com/csp?id=csp_article_content_international&sys_kb_id=eac89167db3048900a2af56e0f96193b)disney announced it for switch but it is still not out for switch might still be in developmentI would like an interactive map of Disneyland/California Adventure where the map includes icons placed around the park that correlate to a movie or show. Then you just click on the icon to play. Like click on the Dumbo ride to get your Dumbo movie options, ect.Also I think I\\'m just bored working from home and realize this is silly.Have you tried asking the Oracle?I would like if the Pixar films had all of the content that was on their old DVDs. The bonus features are lacking for now in my opinion.Surely this thread should be pinned and not the other two individual ones? Otherwise non Europe people don\\'t have a talk hubFinally a discussion flair been waiting for oneAwesomodsAMENYou can only pin two. And seeing as people don’t read it’s easier to have them labeled instead of having a click through to send them to those mega threads.This.I switched mine out for a Roku in the end as it was like a 3rd of the price of a new one. The apps were starting to become end of life so I think it\\'s a lost cause unless you want to upgrade.Never. 100%. It’s a legacy device.Thanks.Not necessarily. They updated it to put Apple TV+ on thereTheir own streaming service... can’t compare the two at all.If they can put their own app on there its possible they can add others. Is it likely? No. But its not 100% out of the questionIt’s not happening. What are they waiting for? The device is getting older and older. There’s also rumours of a new Apple TV coming this summer making it even older.You do make a good point, but they do continue to support the device, in fact it got an update just yesterday.I don’t think it’s features though is it? It’s more general security and bugs. Apple want you to buy a new Apple TV at the end of the day. I don’t see any benefit for them. Sucks though.Tell your toddler to learn some patience.I think it’s ridiculous that they have the international credits in the US. For example, Lamp Life and Purl are each 7 minutes long with a reasonable run time for domestic credits (less than a minute), but then 3-4 minutes of international credits (which is just white text on a black background with no audio). I think it’s good they have literally a dozen dubs for those shorts, but it’s not really necessary to have between 1/4-1/3 of the short being international credits that nobody would watch, especially if they’re watching it in English.People who worked hard to bring an animated short together deserve their credit so, no, that doesn\\'t bother me that they are rightfully being credited for their work. It takes a whole team of animators to create any animation, even if it\\'s a short. Maybe you could teach your toddler how artists work hard and no job is too small, and that\\'s why the credits are so long.Yes, that’s exactly what I was getting at. I wasn’t trying to say credits shouldn’t exist.Thank you I was just complaining about that earlier today.You are a true hero!Thank you so much for this, especially the Bonkers part, had a very difficult time trying to find that order on my ownThis issue has become very annoying. I don’t want to look it up on google to see what episodes to watch correctly, I just want it to be correct on Disney+Yes, it\\'s also important to watch all of the Lucky episodes before Miranda, despite what the production order, Disney+ or even the aired order says.I agree, having to even make this thread at all shows how big the issue is.At least you can watch these shows. Lots of them (Bonkers, TaleSpin, Hercules, Emperor’s New School, Teacher’s Pet, Doug) are not available on Disney+ in Europe. I’d take a wrong episode order any day to just have access to this content!Same. Xmen is missing episodes and out of order.Teacher\\'s Pet and Doug are available in the UK.Yeah, I\\'m going to do X-Men TAS, 2010\\'s Ducktales and Tangled in another thread.Yes, but not in most other European markets. The UK is slightly better off in this respect.Yep, that does seem to be the experience others have complained about since launch (regardless of SARS-CoV-2 bandwidth throttling, which is not the same as resolution throttling). Disney uses some of the most restrictive Widevine DRM settings. Specs imply that if the monitor, cable, and video card are HDCP 2.2 compliant, and can successfully complete the HDCP handshake, it might work at higher resolution in Edge, but I have not seen anyone say it works.For everyone who is downvoting, you are mixing the \"epidemic\" statement wrongly:Here in Spain, there are A LOT of films which are not FullHD/4K. Okay, that could be because the coronavirus.But! there are some in 4k (A Bug Life, Toy Story 4, etc...) which every single one can watch it in 4k in their TV\\'s, or using the xbox app, fireTV, etc...&#x200B;But in the browsers, every single film is capped at 720p. A quick search in this subreddit found me some users reporting the same 3 months ago in USA, so it is not related to the Coronarivus at all. Like this one:   [https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/ef5y9w/cant\\\\_stream\\\\_in\\\\_1080p\\\\_using\\\\_firefoxchromeedge\\\\_on/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/ef5y9w/cant_stream_in_1080p_using_firefoxchromeedge_on/)At last it works for you. I\\'m in Germany, getting error code 83 on Chrome and can\\'t watch anything. Good stuff.I dont have a clue whats going on but im watching the Clone Wars at the moment and it looks much better on my PC than on my phoneBro a quick google says its limited to 720p due to the high usage from Corona isolation. Makes sense. Either we watch at a lower quality or we dont get to watch at all.Finnally someone who doesnt repeat \"is because the coronavirus\" as everyone does without thinking a bit. I have tried also Edge (the old one and the new one) but in both, it says im playing in 720p... Also, the website interface doesnt offer the quality video info, which it appears in every other app (Tv\\'s, consoles, fire TV\\'s, etc...) , so it is other indicative that everything is set up to just HD.Did you try Firefox? It Works for me. I am from germany tooI think they reduced bitrate not resolutionWhere did you hear that? It’s been that way in the US since November, **before** COVID-19 isolation.Happy cake day!I dont think that is the cause, to be honest. There are plenty of ppl who can watch in 1080p in other apps (xbox, smartTV\\'s, etc...) with no problem. Even in 4K i think.>Also, the website interface doesnt offer the quality video info, which it appears in every other app How do I trigger the quality info? Neither the Android App nor my TV (also Android) show anything.Not working either. I tried Chrome in incognito and it works, so I disabled all my extensions in normal mode and it didn\\'t work either. The Android app works.

It nowhere says in which resolution the media is playing currently (like Prime Video does e.g.)I started The Lion King in 4k yesterday (on Android TV) and it just looked crap.. it was in no way 4k neither 1080p.

As i said before, there are plenty of ppl who can watch even in 4k with no problem in their TV\\'s, or other apps. The issue is only on browsers, which is capped on 720p, and it is NOT related to the epidemicThere is no limit on the number of devices that you can be associated with your account. The 10 devices only refers to downloads on mobile devices, not how many devices you can log into with your account.If you’re logged in yes. It’s the number of times your login credentials being tracked.In fact on your PC if you login twice, once using chrome and once using Firefox, that’s 2 devices.Source?I don’t think that’s true.that shouldnt be the 4 simultaneous stream limit?I know i can\\'t see it on more than 4 devices at the same time, but what i\\'m asking for is if also the browsers are counted toward the device\\'s limit(or maybe i didnt understand your answer idk)I\\'ll make an example:if i watch D+ on google chrome from my PC, then do the same on 9 more different PCs (always from chrome/firefox/whatever browser) and then i try to install the app on my tablet/phone, will it tell me that i already registered 10 devices or not?From [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/disney-plus-screens-how-many-devices-once-screen-limit-1471400)>download movies and TV series on up to 10 mobile devicesFrom [TechHive](https://www.techhive.com/article/3434565/disney-device-streaming-limits-could-be-big-problem.html)>While the company previously said that users would only be able to use 10 devices total, it now says that limit only applies to downloads on mobile devices. “There is no limit on the number of devices that can be associated with your account,” spokeswoman Jessica Casano said.”From [TechHive](https://www.fastcompany.com/90395063/heres-all-the-fine-print-on-the-disney-streaming-service)>Contrary to what Disney told us previously, Disney+ will not have a cap on how many devices subscribers can use.

The number of titles stored at one time on a device depends on how much storage space is available on the device.4 simultaneous streams is how many people are actively watching at any given point in time.   It has nothing to do with the 10 login limit.  It’s unclear to me what happens when the 10 login limit is reached.  I haven’t tried it, but I think when you log in an 11th device some other device will get logged out,Awesome thank youthat\\'s my problem i\\'d really love to avoid login on non \"necessary\" devices if it\\'s gonna lock me out after, but if i can simply logoff from browsers then the problem is nearly non-existantI finally managed to contact disney plus support, they told me browsers are not counted toward the 10 devices limit!Yay!No problem. I also found it on the Disney+ FAQ.From [Disney+](https://help.disneyplus.com/csp?id=csp_article_content&sys_kb_id=06a562dcdbc940d03c0cf158bf9619ec)>You can download the same title as many times as you want on up to 10 devicesThere seems to be a misconception that you are only limited to 10 devices. You are not.  You can use as many devices as you want.  Only the last 10 you use will keep your login credentials.Shame the mobile app is garbageOnward\\'s early release is for the U.S only unfortunatelyso it will probably arrive in October everywhere else (unless Disney makes it globally in the future)I get the strong impression that the Dutch version of Disney+ is the worst version at this point. The list of content that we are not getting here is growing every week. No Bonkers, no TaleSpin, only 10 classic cartoons, no Doug, no Teacher’s Pet, no Emperor’s New School, no Hercules series, no Rescuers, no Mickey’s Christmas Carol. Also most ‘60s-‘70s era films that were added in the US are missing and we got none of the Walt-era television shows. The worst thing is that Disney flat out refuses to give a valid reason for this... extremely disappointing!It hasn\\'t been confirmed officially by D+ NL, but they did follow up D+ US by releasing Frozen II earlier. So let\\'s hope Onward will be released D+ NL on april 3rd too... ;)I’m sorry for that, that’s unfortunate. Really hope it’s like Frozen 2 where it was worldwideFrozen 2 wasn’t worldwide.

In Ireland thoughI’ve enjoyed my time with it so far, I’ve seen a bunch of The Simpson’s episodes, the 2013 Mickey Mouse shorts and finally got around to watching Frozen (which I found pretty good, but too many songs (not really much of a negative just a nitpick)). Looking forward to watching more, especially The Mandalorian and the Pixar/Marvel/Star wars movies I’ve missed out in the past.Does it have english subtitles for every film/series? I am hard of hearing and cannot watch anything without them.Also another question: is there a list of everything that\\'s on it? I would want to see what\\'s available as I\\'m already paying for Netflix and Amazon Prime.[removed]Where’s Hercules Tv series! GuttedCan\\'t wait for the nordic countries :Pyeahs its working for me too irelandProof?Let\\'s me log in a search.  Cannot download the app on android yet.The Mandalorian only has 2 episodes available right now. I\\'m assuming they\\'re going to release new episodes weekly even though the show finished \"airing\" back when it was launched in US. So stupid.Great for kids, disappointing for adults, unless you want to venture back to the old days of course, not enough grown up content for me though.What a disappointment compared to DisneyLife.You lose the access to Disney channel, Disney XD and Disney Junior and it costs £1 a month more for hardly anymore content than you got before (no 8 star wars films and part of the MCU isn\\'t much of a jump in content)Enjoy the definition of flop!Hurrah the Simpsons Sex Pistols episode is uncut! Bollocks!Why cant I find the app on my Samsung 4k smart tvThanks! Great to finally be able to browse this sub without envyFeels good to finally have it.It doesn\\'t work I try going on it and it says streaming starts November 2019 I can\\'t start a subscription help> Welcome to all our UK subscribers!Dude, its available not only in UK but a ton of EU countries today..Where can you see upcoming releases?This is disappointing! It says on the app it is because of existing arrangements so I doubt they will put it on early. I imagine it might be with Sky? I would of hoped the deal they struck with them to put the app on Sky Q would have included the relaxation there though :(   I hope Onward is released at the same time as others are getting it.They probably fixed this real quick because Sky would most definitely sue them because the contract is up in 2 hours.I bought the preorder then just clicked on log in, did that and it took me to the normal websiteSPRICHIt’s been postponed to April 7 here in France! I’m gutted!I work at a cinema and we recently watched Sky High at one of our film club nights, genuinely one of the best original superhero films ever madeYes! Love that film**SIDEEEEE KICK**Enjoy! America doesn\\'t get it until next yearI am experiencing the same problem on my LG SL9YG. I have no problems with Netflix dolby atmos movie and the dolby atmos notification shows on the soundbar. But  Disney+ just shows dolby atmos in the app but doesn\\'t pass through atmos to the soundbar. There is something wrongI’m having the same issue, although I’ve noticed atmos seems to have disappeared from Netflix too. I’m thinking it might be a casualty of the reduced streaming bitrates in place across Europe during the pandemic. But can’t confirm that anywhere yet.I noticed this as well with my LG TV app, passing to my avr, all other steaming apps are passing Dolby Atmos fine just no Disney plus.If you find out a fix or when we might get a fix please let me know!Similar issue here with Amazon Fire TV Cube (2019 / 2nd gen). The app shows Dolby Atmos labels on content, but when played, my AV receiver confirms it\\'s only receiving Dolby Digital+ 5.1. Whereas the same hardware confirms Dolby Atmos 5.1.2 from both Amazon Video (eg Jack Ryan) and Netflix (eg Altered Carbon).I found [some older posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/dx9b33/devices_with_dolby_visionatmos_and_hdr_support/) from users outside Europe that confirmed that Atmos was working on Apple TV 4K - before covid-19 restrictions at least - so it\\'s possible your Apple TV issue is just relating to the throttled streams.I cannot find anywhere confirming that Atmos ever worked on the Fire TV Cube 2019 though, and plenty of evidence that it didn\\'t at launch, so have no idea whether Atmos would be working on my device were it not for the covid-19 issues, or whether the app has been broken in this way all along.try clearing your cache mines workingYes main account sign in for everyone (same as Netflix) and then setup profiles.With AT&T since it\\'s a Warner Bros owned show.Pretty sure they\\'ve going to release the rest on a weekly schedule. General theory is that it\\'s to stop people from burning through everything during their free trial and then cancelling their subscription.They announced last week they were being released weekly.Another one on Friday - then one a week each Friday!There\\'s quite a few. Simpsons, Avatar, all the Ice Age movies, a lot of the X Men movies, all the Home Alone movies.Hi. When I installed the app it said it only supports the up, down, left and right buttons. Magic remote to be supported in a future update.Not sure I use Apple TV 4K with my LG OLED.I\\'m having the same issues. Do you also have the problem with episode selection? Moving from one episode to another within a programme takes 14 seconds for me.Meant to be fixed in \\'first quarter\\' according to American articles.. it\\'s impossible to watchHey are you also noticed some weird quality issues? Like the lines seemed blurred and shimmering. I think this might be the lowering of the bitrate because of COVID-19..Whenever I try to login on browser it redirects me to the countdownDo we know when the apps will be? Google tells me they SHOULD be, but its not the case.On browser?How??Rumour has it they\\'re limiting the exclusives for now so people won\\'t binge watch the entire show on their trial week and not purchase the month.That\\'s weird I\\'m on Chrome and it\\'s workingI’m installing Firefox now ahaha. Nope it doesn’t work.Lucky! I’m in Ireland trying to login on browser.No it’s not for me. I’m raging ahaha[deleted]iOS app not availableI googled the app for android and it was able to get it that way, still can\\'t see it on xb1 though.> Was anyone else expecting stuff like HSMTMTS and the Imagineering StoryPretty pissed off after watching the first episode of the Imagineering Story to find out that they only had 1 episode up. Considering it\\'s fully out in the US I have absolutely no idea why they would keep it from European subscribers, especially with all the lockdowns going on.I suspect their model is that they want people to pay for at least 2 months, so any series over 4 episodes is released weekly, which sucks for people that have paid for the year in one whole go.Works using mobile data, but good luck trying to get it on WiFi - and that includes TV devices.[removed][deleted]The Xbox website is currently telling me the app isn’t currently available. Not a big deal, we will be using our Sky Q box or Samsung TV once they’ve updated with the app.X-Men Evolution is a Warner Bros show so is owned by AT&T.Fox had the live action film licence but TV animation is usually on a show by show licence.It\\'s live nowYour post on the Disney+ Subreddit was removed due to a Rule 2 violation:\"No posts about piracy or VPNs.

I can watch from my PC, but my XBOX and PC cannot download the app, and its not on the PS store at all for me.You just have to search for the title. Occasionally titles with future release dates appear in search notifying you of the dateI’m annoyed on all the websites previewing Disney+ they mentioned Frozen 2 and when I subscribed this morning they tell me July 17th not on. Plus it seems i now have two subscriptions one to Disney life and now this, why couldn’t they have migrated the two. Oh well far far more worrying things in the world right nowBefore the other regions got an earlier release they also had June/July dates to allow for the home video/digital release window so it’s possible we don’t have to wait that long.  Fingers crossedZARATHUSTRAI live in Norway, and it isn’t coming here until “mid 2020”.

Please may I ask if you could quickly check if HD and 4K content is available. I don’t want to pre order and find out nothing’s there. Thank you.Edit: got the 7 day free trial. HDR is on for 4K titles. Resolution is a different story, it may be 1080p. It’s certainly not the best 4K streaming I’ve seen, but HDR is far more important imo.ScummyThey need to add the info to the app then because most people won’t have seen that message and will only use the app. I’ve had to come on here to find that info for my kids.Well I didn\\'t wanna torrent the show, but after waiting to finally be able to pay for the service to watch it (wanna binge it since it I\\'m off work due to the virus), they\\'re now making me wait even longer to see it all the way through, gonna stream the first two whilst downloading the entire seasonOh cool. I haven\\'t explored it as much as I should have then. I can see one home alone movie but I will try to find the rest. The x men movies would be great (well the first 2...)It looks like some weird anti aliasing that they\\'ve used in upscaling SD resolution episodes to HD.Yeah go to pre order page and just click login at the topJust navigated to website, logged in and it took me to the main landing/category page.

Debating whether or not to cancel in principle ([this tweet](https://twitter.com/DisneyPlusUK/status/1241805846977413122) certainly makes it sound like the whole series was going to come out at once.

That\\'s ages awayDU HURENSOHN!I thought that initially but I couldn\\'t find anywhere that the restriction would affect sound quality as well. Waiting to see if anyone confirms they have Atmos working in the UK, if not maybe it is due to thatThey are both there but they are reducing streaming quality for a while to put less strain on broadband networks.HDR is pretty much fake on D+ anyway.After renting a couple of HDR movies from YouTube, I can definitely see that Disney+ is lying.It was obvious to me what they were doing (YMMV). If all of the Mandalorian was already up, I would have watched the whole series before the 7 day trial was over. This way Disney are guaranteeing themselves at least 2 months of subs.There is very little else to keep me subscribing until Falcon and The Winter soldier is available.X-Men 1, 2, First Class and Days of Future Past are all considered to be pretty good.Yes, exactly. I used to watch streamed SD episodes a while back and honestly I think it looked better.Yeah I’ve done that this is what happens when I try. https://imgur.com/gallery/7cBBxIjLucky this is what happens for me. https://imgur.com/gallery/7cBBxIjGlad I already watched from alternative sources then :)Still subscribing for a month or so to replace my DisneyLife sub and catch up on a few old favs.Shame really that Star Wars and Marvel adds so little for me personally since I own all those on Disc.None yet unfortunatelyI really don\\'t think that tweet suggests it\\'s all there on day one.

Their Help Page says HD and 4K may be unavailable altogether. Maybe it’s other countries.this, the apps arent up atm but trying the browser (which works) its unfortunatly limitedIt’s obvious to everyone why they’ve done this. My main gripe is the lack of info available on the app re scheduling. As of yesterday there was no info re new episodes for Mandalorian. Ok it’s a small gripe however I don’t really want to have to look elsewhere to find out the info.First class isn\\'t on Disney+ in the UK.Oh i’m on my laptop maybe that’s whyI\\'d probably try on a PC or laptop if you can. I don\\'t know if the mobile website is working yet. I\\'m on PC.I think most people are trying on desktops. Its working for me on Chrome on my laptopI get same.People are theorising that they\\'re limiting the exclusive shows so people don\\'t binge watch them on their free week and don\\'t purchase a subscription.Pretty dumb, I\\'m just gonna go and watch the rest of the episodes via other methods as soon as I\\'ve seen the 2 on there.Try refreshing cause it definitely is working for me i watching mandalorianAh this is what I was looking for earlier, must be due to this then :(Thanks for sharing that!So no HD? I’m sorry for bugging you but I’m really hesitant to sink the money for the preorder without a date for HD/4K.Do you know if the apps are normally up? I booked the day off to sofa binge with my daughters on the consoles, but its currently not looking great for XBOX or PS4.Yeah I tried pc before this. It doesn’t work. Must’ve fixed it.Try Firefox. I got in.It\\'s not like you didn\\'t know it was going to be released weekly. They did announce it.If you’ve waited this long you can wait a few more weeks. Sure it’s annoying but it’s also understandable - they’re a business, they want to make money.Yeah I have. Idk why it’s not working lolI contacted Disney+ about this issue and they said they tested it on their hardware (LG OLED and marantz AVR) with the covid restrictions and it worked fine. Could be we\\'re having more throttling than others? Or could be an error in the app? Either way I\\'m sad I can\\'t watch the mandalorian in Atmos, or do the MCU marathon I was planning 😔😔I’d be shocked if it wasn’t at least in 1080p with just a lower bitrate. 4K I guess is hard to tell. I’m sure someone is going to share streaming stats once the Apple TV app is up, if not before through the browser.4K DV and HD is available if you use the app (Android TV, mine was sideloaded).its fine, its worth it psubbing for a year i doubt the bandwidth downgrade will last that long its hdPossibility that they are staggering access to spread out the demand. I\\'m sure everyone will get on in the next couple of hours. Best of luck.Well, I didn\\'t know that. Still dumb.Thing is most people I know in UK that have bought Disney+ have already watched it when it was released in US. I get what people are saying re the trials and people burning through it however limit the trials to some content then and allow people who’ve paid to watch how they want. Or those of us that’ve paid 12 months up front to access it.It’s working for me I got the preview page and just clicked log in up the topI can see that being a better way to please us with 12 month subs etc but if people in the free trials can’t watch any of the content they want might just not bother continuing as they’ll lose interest.The thing is, if people were that excited for Disney+ they’d already know that these series were being released slowly rather than all at once, as I’ve read that’s what would happen a number of times online. So it really shouldn’t be a surprise - and people should have made their choice on subbing based on that, if they’re not bothered by access to the large back catalogue of movies etc.All fair points and I understand why they’ve done it. My kids knew how US had released content but thought/hoped it might have been done differently here. Wishful thinking on their part!Where can they see the info on release dates etc? Especially for films like Onward.I’m not sure if there’s a full list of confirmed dates for things, especially films like Onward which are (were, I suppose?) still in cinemas. I know for Frozen 2 it lists 17th July on the app due to licensing, I guess with Sky as they have it on Sky Store at the moment. Hopefully there will be some sort of update on what’s coming when though.>Are they planning on releasing the rest of the Imagineering story on Disney+ UK?Why wouldn\\'t they. it\\'s already complete at least for season 1 if they decide to continue and I really hope they do. >If so does anyone know when?Sounds like they are doing weekly release like they initially wanted to do with Mandalorian despite both shows being complete.Each Friday. Same for all original content.Thanks! Hopefully it won\\'t be too long before we\\'re caught up with the US.The EU isn\\'t doing anything. Disney Plus [announced](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/disney-plus-cut-overall-bandwidth-194258866.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9kdWNrZHVja2dvLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKt9RHn3362k6u5Sx4reZmizlI9HhutdbqS2nSve_T3xXwOzdbLGRD-3kFpMiz7PIfRo99pW6Qt57jO8l3glhM7a2Tt328RApKE4vLVjaR6yY3EO-4Z6BqlIqqZB05Xa77ZqxWHQn3_hm1Iq8lQo5aeA8QnYPUnY6bBrfAU92uN0) that they would scale down the maximum available resolution within the EU for the time being.Toy Story 1 and 4 are in 4k no? I noticed 2 and 3 are just HD though.Lion King, Little Mermaid appear as 4k on Fire StickSame here in Spain, it\\'s mainly an issue of the computer animated films, both Pixar and Disney\\'s (well, and weridly enough, the Disney Star Wars films: TFA, RO, TLJ and Solo)Marvel, The Lion King, the X-Men films, Roger Rabbit, just to put some examples, work at 4K HDR/DV4k is coming for eu its for netflix to its as eu  bandwith rule atm cous of the virus so the internet will not overloadNo the Resolution stays the same. Just the bitrate gets lowered. And other titles are streaming in 4K like f.e the Marvel movies. All animation Movies are only in HD though which is sad cause in the US they are all available in 4K.And yeah the EU isn‘t doing it themselves but they requested the lowering of the bitrate on streaming services. Netflix did the same, still 4K but lower bitrate.we don\\'t even have toy story 4 in germanyToy story 4 comes in April i believe. The Live Action remakes are in 4k over here though.For me in Germany every Star Wars is in 4K except Force Awakens and Rogue One.That‘s really weird. Feels like they should‘ve waited a bit more till they got all the licensing right. Cause this is kinda a mess right now to be honest.has nothing to do with the rule.  other titles are in 4 kI spoke to Disney+ and in some cases, this means that movies/shows are HD only. They even write this on their troubleshooting site.If Netflix and Amazon are cropping movies to fit the screen then shame on them!Letterboxes are a good thing. If those films were cropped to fit the height of your tv screen you would actually be losing a large portion of the image, and ruining what the creators of that film intended.Some films are 2.35:1 vs standard 16:9 windscreen TVs which are 1.85:1. For those films in 1.85:1 on a windscreen tv you’ll have no bars. For 2.35:1 you will. Doesn’t answer why the same film on Netflix has a different ratio.Can you be specific with what films have a different aspect ratio on Netflix?Cropping is never a good thing. Some shows on Dinsey+ are subject to it, sadly.Netflix nor Amazon should be messing with the Aspect Ratio of movies. Could you give at least 2 examples of this so we can complain to them.Disney+ has reduced bitrate in order to ease internet serversEven in the US where the quality isn\\'t purposely downgraded, a 4K Blu-ray disc will ALWAYS look/sound better than what\\'s available via streaming.Physical media will always look better than streaming, even without the decrease in quality imposed because of quarentine. 1080p Bluray >>> 4K Streaming.Not that this would entirely account for the difference but D+ is currently using at least 25% less bitrate in Europe for its streams in order to help destress ISPs as more and more people turn to streaming services for entertainment during various lockdowns. The same for Netflix.Ok, didn\\'t know they had done it already, makes sense thank youdoes not explain muted colors and black crush etc.   They converted a lot of films and even upscaled a lot of films and well... i don\\'t think they took the effort to review/test and analysed each title[https://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/disney-plus-hdr-quality-the-mandalorian/](https://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/disney-plus-hdr-quality-the-mandalorian/)Really.  Will have to check that out.Even so, bitrates are going to be less than from a comparable physical media.Blu-ray will always be better quality than 1080p from the streaming services. But most people really won\\'t notice the difference.You\\'re welcome.Great to hear. Hope you\\'re keeping well and staying safe there. Enjoy Disney+ 🖖🖖Subscribed. It is so coolUnfortunately we are missing some titles, or better episodes of already completed series (like Mandalorian and Clone Wars season 7).Why only two chapters I really don\\'t understand.I don\\'t care to have it translated I would watch it anyway in English, so I really hope they will let me choose to have the whole serie/season even if not fully dubbed.Finalmente! Però per rivedere tutto Mandalorian in una qualità decente bisogna aspettare un mese e mezzo che coglioni.Con sta quarantena ci stava tutto.I\\'m in mates! But unfortunately at the moment i can\\'t find the D+ app on my LG LG LF590V (Webos 3.21). Helpdesk told me to wait a couple of days :) I\\'m not a fan of Disney cartoons/movies but i\\'m a fanboy of Pixar, Marvel and Star Wars saga :)Hi I got it yesterday but I\\'m getting no 4k and 5.1 sound. Is it because of the limited bandwidth due to the emergency? Anyway Netflix and Prime Video are still streaming correctly and this made me think there was some issue unrelatedNice[removed]It’s already been announced that they will be showing the Mandalorian weekly, not all at once. It’s not held up with translation of something like that, it’s ready to go now. It simply works better from a marketing perspective to air shows weekly instead of the binge model (because of organic word of mouth marketing). Even Netflix is starting to air shows weekly instead of binge, because it’s much better for the platform health.Da un lato, è una bella fregatura - le puntate sono talmente corte che vale la pena vedersele tutte d\\'un fiato. Dall\\'altro, vai tranquillo che per quando uscirà l\\'ultima puntata la quarantena sarà ancora all\\'inizioLo stan facendo uscire puntata per puntata? Ma che cavolata, grazie al cielo l’ho già visto tuttoEvviva la pirateriaaa!!Na, avevo fatto D+ al rilascio in america (;must be a bug.  mine has the german audio.It’s also only in 1080p, while the other Star Wars movies are all in 4K (here in Germany).Thank you for your feedback. I think I found the bug. I set my profile-language to english. I changed it to german now and now I can see german as an option. :)I set mine to German and I’m still not seeing the dub. I’m not in Germany though so that could be the issueUnder extras on most moviesThey are in the extras.How about TV shows? Can you see the trailers for each season?YesssThere\\'s trailers for seasons of shows?For European users there hasn’t been a clear release schedule so far. Hopefully this will improve now that Disney+ becomes available in more and more European countries.Maybe the D23 Website? Articles are posted monthly of the schedule in the US.Unfortunately they don\\'t provide that information yet because they aren\\'t very organized or transparentWon’t happen. They did this in the NA as well. Otherwise people would binge it with the free trial or cancel shortly afterI think I did read before hand they were going to release it all at once but need to spread it out to keep subscribers during the lockdownThe picture on my 4K Samsung TV is so incredibly dark in so many scenes that it’s virtually unwatchable.[removed]Its weekly like it was originally in AmericaIt’s really unfair and I think Disney is being a fool right now. UK residents can easily go on illegal movie websites and watch the entire series right now. Especially with COVID-19 happening Disney really should just release the whole series. But if COVID-19 never happened, Disney should of released the the entire series none the less. It’s cool that Disney wants to air shows that never been aired weekly, you know that’s a smart business move. But for a series that has already finished airing, that’s not cool that the UK can’t just get the whole series right now. That’s like saying Disney releases weekly episodes for a show such as Wizards of Waverly Place that aired a long time ago. This is a dumb move by Disney.So with that knowledge will we have to wait until after the trial to get the rest of the series (to avoid people abusing the trial)Thanks, I guess I’ll just be patient**Please read this entire message**---> Your comment on r/DisneyPlus was removed due to a Rule 2 violation: \"No posts about piracy or VPNs.\" ---**If you believe this post was removed by mistake, please [contact the Moderators.](https://reddit.com/message/compose/?to=r/disneyplus&subject=Question%20About%20A%20Removal)****Violations may result in a temporary or permanent ban.**But that doesn\\'t make sense? Also why can\\'t we watch the new Episodes of The Clone Wars, which is still releasing new Episodes every week. I don\\'t wanna be 2 weeks behind!Disney acts like I don’t know over 100 people who have already seen the ending and are in the UKTrials only 30 days. Unless that differs there. So you’d only see maybe 3 episodesBecause then people would just watch it during their free trial then cancel. Wouldn\\'t make much business sense to let everyone to binge one of your biggest attractions for free.[removed]Disney is in the fiction business afterall...;)The trial is 7 days so if they do come out with the purchase of the subscription I will have to wait 7 days which is not too badThe clone wars isn\\'t fully out yet. People can still watch it after it\\'s out with their free trial. I paid for it so i should have it. This is bs.Why didnt they just block the rest of the episodes past the first two for people who are using a trial and allow the people who have already paid for a subscription watch the content they paid for?**Please read this entire message**---> Your submission on r/DisneyPlus was removed due to a Rule 2 violation: \"No posts about piracy or VPNs.

You’re 100% right. It’s been awhile since our trial was here. Quickly got it mixed up with Netflix etcI still think they’re going to be released weekly. If that’s the case then if someone was looking to binge them, they’d be smart to get the trial after all episodes are released.That would be a logistical headacheThat would make more senseYou\\'d think Disney would be able to handle something that free-to-play apps do all the time though right? I mean its essentially just locking the rest of the content behind a paywall.In [ ]:Like someone actually uses internet explorer!There have been cases of credentials stuffing on Disney+, so don’t just throw this out as phishing without looking into it.Credentials stuffing basically means people use the same password for everything, but that password leaked in an earlier hack for a different site. Now hackers are just trying those email and password combinations on Disney+, trying to see if they work. Once they find an account they can access, they sell it.All in all: if the email comes from Member.Services@DisneyAccount.com and you’re reusing an old password for your Disney-account, change it now. Once hackers are ‘in’ your Disney+ account, it’s very hard to get them out again. Just changing your password won’t do the trick anymore by then.What’s the phishing scam? Disney has been sending account login notification emails like this for about 3 months now.The site addresses on the button link are not official Disney sites from what I can tell. I don\\'t live in the US so that log in wasn\\'t me (in fact I literally only signed up for Disney+ yesterday) This is almost definitely phishing made to look like the real deal. I logged into my Disney+ at 8am as the app only just became available in the U.k and got a very different email from Disney compared to this with legit addresses.Just warning people.My friend just got identical email, and the links are definitely not legit. Thanks for the warningKeeping an eye open for phishing attacks is always wise. But Disney implemented those notifications for a reason and they shouldn’t be arbitrarily ignored. Speaking as someone who resides in the US, that is exactly what the valid login notifications look like. Disney user accounts are valid across all of their lines of business. One should not simply ignore a notice that someone logged into ESPN.com with their credentials, because an account created at ABC.com, Disney.com or a dozen other sites *would* also work on ESPN. The password reset link should redirect to a go.com site, which is the top level domain on which Disney sites operate.Thanks for the info, I\\'ll contact Disney to find out if this mail is legit - if it is that means they have managed to compromise my login within 1 day of me signing up to the service.He\\'s right, while some of these legit could be phishing scams, any time I log into any of the Disney accounts, I get the notification within a second later.And all Disney accounts use the same password, all interconnected.YOU DO? I\\'ve been using Disney plus for months and I\\'ve never got thatYou don\\'t get it for Disney Plus - you only get it if you log into ESPN, Shop Disney, Disney Movie Insiders, Marvel, and Star Wars. It\\'s similar to what Netflix does when you log in (they send you a new log in email too)Disney Plus is quasi connected (in that when you change your Disney Account Password, it can also change the Disney Plus password to that too) to that same password, but doesn\\'t do the alert.....yet.There\"ll be 2 more episodes every Friday until we\\'re at the same point as the us.Here in Italy we also only have the first 2 episodes of The Mandalorian[removed]That’ll be absolutely obscure (I’m in America) that’s just really unfair and not smart at all. Why not just release the already aired episodes that I’ve seen to the UK?!It\\'ll be added weekly to combat people burning through it during their trail. They did the same with The MandalorianOh thank god, I was worried thereIn which case then we\\'re looking at being synced up by episode 8, so the end of the Ahsoka arc. Just in time for Siege of Mandalore!**Please read this entire message**---> Your submission on r/DisneyPlus was removed due to a Rule 2 violation: \"No posts about piracy or VPNs.

This would be much better than one episode weekly. Glad to hear that there’s a bit of hope :)Wait what, I can\\'t even watch the whole thing now? :(&#x200B;That\\'s what you get for being honest :/[removed]I was very annoyed too seeing only 2 episodes released instead of the whole season! This is ridiculous! Other than that, I’m enjoying Disney+. It’s great and nostalgic!They likely don’t know and you’ll get one episode per week like you’re supposed to. Front line customer service rarely knows what’s really going onI just spoke with the german costumer support about the Simpsons 4:3 issue and they literally send me a random google article. They seem very untrained and unaware of company policy, so take what they say with a grain of salt and don\\'t read too much into it.How can you be so positive about this? There is absolutely no reason for this other than greed.[removed]Well, Disney probably figured out that right after the German launch there would be many people setting up their Disney+ accounts while perhaps planning to binge-watch the entire Mandalorian series during their 7-day trial. Even more disappointing, the series \"The World according to Jeff Goldblum\" only has 1 episode out of 12 available.Smart, but not consumer-friendly, especially in a time where you are basically forced to stay at home anyway. I will definitely cancel my subscription soon as I don\\'t plan on paying them a 2 to 3 month subscription fee just so that I can watch both of these shows in their entirety.&#x200B;Kind of strange that a multi-billion dollar company with all their different acquisitions would be incapable of figuring out a \"watch limit\"-function or something like that. I mean, why would ANYONE purchase a 12-month subscription at this moment when there is absolutely no advantage from a content standpoint?**Please read this entire message**---> Your submission on r/DisneyPlus was removed due to a Rule 2 violation: \"No posts about piracy or VPNs.

Clone Wars, Rebels, Mandalorian... the reason why I’m not extremely annoyed at this point is that I know that when we do catch up, that should be us caught up for good. I totally understand how frustrating it is and in many ways I’m still annoyed that we’re having to wait even longer. But I do think that this is the last delay we’ll have to face for a while.**Please read this entire message**---> Your submission on r/DisneyPlus was removed due to a Rule 2 violation: \"No posts about piracy or VPNs.

People who only want to watch the mandalorian would not have bought longer times anyways, the total package has to be right for a service like this. And the total package doesn\\'t look appealing due to this policy. You kind of feel treated worse than their home audience...The 16:9 is brutal on the older episodes. I was really taken back by how much it impacts the image. Even the TV at the end of the opening credits is missing so much at the top and bottom. It\\'s great that we have The Simpsons on the service but hopefully this can be fixed soon as I just can\\'t watch the older episodes like this.Same here. That’s really crappy but early 2020 can go till May.It is a disgrace, it\\'s not only Simpsons but some old school disney eps like Chip N Dale. Luckily Ducktales is not effected.I wouldn\\'t be surprised if that was the original intent but then sending folks home due to COVID-19 (and reprioritizing other work as things started unraveling) delayed it.I just said this. I started watching it and the aspect ratio really ruins it. Need it fixed soonA lot of us did but they are incredibly unreliable when it comes to improving the service itselfContact costumer service and let them know this should be a priorityPeople complained that the visual gags are gone which is true but then I saw more issues. There are some shots that clearly don’t look right at all. Like they’ll be times where the top of characters heads are cut off, their arms are cut off, legs, vehicle bottoms, etc... it’s just absolute trash.Yeah. I can see that being the messaging for any delay but I still can\\'t understand why it wasn\\'t fixed almost immediately as the 4:3 files already are archived and were part of the Simpsons World app so could have just been copied across, no?I would watch Clone Wars firstIt’s hard to say, depends on how much time you have to watch. Rebels will always be there. Having said that I of course am watching the final season of Clone Wars after already having seen Rebels. If they were both over already I’d have to watch them in order or my brain itches.The final season of The Clone Wars was written years ago, before Rebels was in development. Any then-untold story was in consideration when writing any connections in Rebels. You can, and should, watch the entire series before Rebels.My watch/read guide, in recommended order:1. The Clone Wars (movie/seasons 1-6)2. Crystal Crisis on Utapau story reels, Son of Dathomir comic series, Dark Disciple novel)3. The Clone Wars (season 7)4. Rebels5. Ahsoka (novel)Clone wars first and I suggest using this guide for it to watch it in chronological order and skip the filler episodeshttps://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/dvfnex/best_of_the_clone_wars_arcs/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share*Edit: watch the clone wars movie before the series, it introduces AshokaClone Wars comes before Rebels.Thanks!No I’m asking in which order I should watch themFor anyone who wants to watch the whole series without skipping anything.

It should release in Norway somewhen in Summer.Disney+ won’t be available in Norway until this summer.

Slán AbhaileI’m glad they added those extras to Last Jedi. REALLY hope they bring back the isolated soundtrack version, but WHYYYY would they remove things from Revenge of the Sith?!Edit: I’m not seeing that deleted scenes without commentary showing up yet. Maybe it’ll roll out eventually to USAAre you in an area that just started the service today? If so, it might take a little bit time for it to process. There is a high demand, and with the coronavirus, it may be even longer.I would be patient, and if you are receiving the service, just make sure you have the money in your account for when they do take it out.Disney Plus was released around 17h ago in GermanyDisney own marvel and Star Wars so that content should stay.I think in the US in a few years some of the films go back to Netflix for a few months but I don’t think a deal like that exists here in the UK.things that are contractually obligated to Netflix and/or other services will leave the service temporarily. (This is also why stuff like Infinity War and Incredibles 2 are still on Netflix) Or if legal issues such as music rights arise.   Or sensitive issues like the Andi Mack actor being a pedophile arise.I think with Star Wars and Marvel, they won\\'t leave the platform.Probably not as we have seen several shows  (thinking of home alone) in America that have been on disney plus and left so I doubt it’ll be different in the U.K. but I think it will happen **a lot** less frequently due to the fact disney owns all their properties and therefore chooses what platform they go on as a posed to Netflix that bid on things for a certain period of time and pretty much everything that they buy leaves at one pointI don’t know that anything is truly permanent, but I think the originals will be and most older content.Hopefully the Simpsons is here to stayDisney plus just came out today in the UK and home alone is on it here.Yes I know I was pointing out the fact in America it was there and then left as a example that occasionally shows leave and returnHome Alone is owned by by 20th Century Fox, which is now owned by DisneyIn [ ]:There’s a data saver mode for mobile devices, but otherwise, no.This might sound counter intuitive, but does the TV (I know Roku has this) itself ability to limit the streaming resolution to 1080p?Any way to even check what resolution the stuff is running on PC?I\\'m curious to see if it\\'s a browserthing like with Netflix or if I can get 1080p / 4k on everythingData caps are the goddamned devil.

Will Onward on it in April like the US?Somehow there are only the first three seasons of Agents of SHIELD available in Germany, the two other seasons aren\\'t available on any other streaming platform :/I was really looking forward seeing them..I just want everyone to know that in Spain (maybe other countries too), Iron Man 1 is distributed by Sony (along with The Incredible Hulk, and, like the rest of the world, the 2 Spider-Man movies), so maybe we will never have the first Iron Man in Disney+.UK here, wondering why there\\'s on two episodes of the mandalorian? You guys better not be slow releasing it -\\\\_-  Edit: Bit of googling / asking around, searching this subreddit reveals that the mandalorian will be a weekly release. So in 5 weeks we\\'ll have all the episodes.  I assumed at first that they were doing this because I was on a 7 day trial. That would make sense: The trial gives you a taster, pay the sub if you want the rest.  That\\'s not what this is though. This and MANY other shows from what I can tell are all on weekly releases, and Disney+ have openly stated (see the other threads on the subreddit) that this is so they can retain customers for months rather than days.  Business wise: Yeah, sure I see that.  Customer wise: \\\\*\\\\*Expletive\\\\*\\\\* that. I\\'m out. All the other streaming services don\\'t act this way, why do you?   Note: But lathey, netflix has staggered releases! Yes, usually because it\\'s tied to an actual release on a TV channel. I could be wrong, but I feel cheated here, so I cancelled my sub.  @ Disney+ let me know if you decide to start playing nice.  Also: Asking 6 pounds a month for a tiny fraction of what I can get for the same price elsewhere is downright criminal.For some reason in germany/Austria both the mandalorian and clone wars currently only have the first two episodes, despite both series being fully dubbed alreadyIn the UK, we seem to have Ice Age, Ice Age 2, then Ice 4.Where are 3 and 5?Does anyone know why the uk doesn’t have seasons 3 and 4 of Star vs the forces of evil but the first two are thereIn the uk, the Tower of Terror tv movie isn\\'t availableStar butterfly Vs the evil season 3 and 4 in the UK.Rest of the world seems to have it except us 😫UK.

Now I saw that there are only the seasons 1 to 3 avalaible. Does anyone know why? Maybe someone knows something about some licenses deals that are still given to other stream services?ThanksWhere\\'s Aladdin film (2019) in Spain?any idea when will 101 Dalmatian street be releasing in the uk? I also find it a bit ironic since its not on the uk disney+ even tho it takes place in londonWe don\\'t have the Dinosaurs TV show or the Honey I Shrunk the Kids show in the ukThe first 7 episodes of avengers earth\\'s mightiest heroes are out of orderAny word on even Stevens seriesSmart Guy was there on release (UK) but has since been mysteriously taken down.The Suite Life of Zack & Cody is missing the episodes \"Smart & Smarterer\" and \"Doin\\' Time in Suite 2330\". At least here in the US.We are missing two of the 3 Night at the Museum movies In the ukSmart guy available for a few hours...then REMOVED!So I\\'ve just been to disney about this. After getting through one very unhelpful agent (Goddamm Barbera) , one then finding a more helpful agent, he explained it has been temporarily blocked...but that\\'s all for the moment. It\\'s either availability/licensing negligence, or false advertising surely , as it was available and I streamed 3 episodes on Monday 2am (I know but this show was the main reason to get Disney+ as I\\'ve already seen mandolorian) and then removed by the afternoon. Never heard of a service taking down content within hours of its release. They also tried to say \"some episodes may be removed due to etc etc\" , but I explained it\\'s the whole show. I also think that I only know of this as I love Smart guy, but how many other shows or movies were confirmed , advertised , people bought the service and then they were removed. Who knows. Concern has been raised and I have my ref number etc, awaiting a response or explanation, and then will update here.UK, Dog with a BlogStarted watching yesterday, in Germany, and it only has 2 episodes of The Mandalorian and Clone Wars each... wth is up with that? I’m sorry if this is the wrong place for my comment but idk where else to turn toWhere. Is. W.I.T.C.HHi there. Does anyone know why Fantastic 4: Earth\\'s Greatest Heroes, Wolverine and the X-Men and X-men Evolution aren\\'t available on Disney+ in the UK, and if they will be in future? While there\\'s plenty of other great stuff to watch, one of the reasons I bought Disney+ was to watch these shows, so for them to not be there is extremely disappointing. Thank you for any help offered.The *Disneyland* and *Walt Disney\\'s Wonderful World of Colour* specials are missing everywhere as far as I know and I\\'d really love to see those. (Except for one episode of World of Colour available in the US - none in the UK?)My understanding is that Disney owns 20th Century Fox, so one I would like is:A Walk in the Clouds (1995)I am in New ZealandCan someone access US content from the UK?Are the 20th Century Fox animated movies like Anastasia & FernGully likely to be available at any point?And what about more Fox cartoons?So far they just seem to have The Simpsons & The old Marvel showsAlso what about Young Indiana Jones Chronicles?2 of the ice age movies are missing on the uk versionIce age 3 dawn of the dinosaur  Ice age 5 collision course The other 3 are on this already but I won’t watch them till all 5 are onUK is missing Toy Story 2, the Cars trilogy & Ratatouille in 4K from their Pixar collection.Since you buttheads allways remove my posts, here\\'s how you want it:I woke up this morning, all excited to use Disney+ and I gotta say first impressions are kinda dissapointing.Mandalorian has only 2 Episodes up.The Clone Wars Season 7 has only 2 Episodes up. Will I really have to watch it 2 weeks behind the US? That ain\\'t fair! Especially since I pay almost 1.5x as much as the US ($69.99 --> $102.43)The Rise of Skywalker is not on there at all. Home release will be March 31st, hopefully they\\'ll have it until then.Star Wars Resistance is not up there and not mentioned at all, I can\\'t find nothing. Wtf?Avengers Endgame won\\'t be available until September 24th. Why? Netflix doesn\\'t have it either, the home release was September 5th 2019.Non of the Spider-Man MCU movies are there either.Mulan 1 is still on Netflix, but that\\'s kinda ok since they probably have to wait until their contract with Netflix runs out.And that\\'s just 10 minutes of poking around and seeing what stuff they have.This is above and beyond my wildest dream of what might be posted here. Take the gold! All the gold!Dr Dolittle 1998 coming April 1!anyone know why home alone was removed?No TaleSpin is outrageous!!!For X-Men, missing:\\\\- X-Men: First Class {With Sky/Now TV, says streaming until 02 Sep 2021}  \\\\- X-Men: Apocalypse  Plus Logan, Deadpool and Deadpool 2, but those aren\\'t really expected to be added due to 18 (\"R\") rating.MCU missing The Incredible Hulk, Spider-Man: Homecoming and Spider-Man: Far From Home as expected due to distribution rights situation with Universal and Sony.Also Agents of Shield season 6 (although I think that’s due to Channel 4 having the rights) Star Wars Resistance and the Resistance shorts (they were on Disney life) are missing as wellit’s a bummer, i really wanted to catch up on Star vs, and to see the UK doesn’t have season 3 and 4 (my faves) is so sad. hope they add them on soon ✌️🥺Quite a lot of Disney shows are missing from what I have found.

(Stomps upstairs, slams door)Additionally, these shows are also missing:BlueyBonkersMickey Mouse ClubSpin and MartyThe Proud FamilyThe Replacements&#x200B;The Aladdin series isn\\'t available anywhere.I don\\'t think Ducktales does have any missing episodes, because for some reason season 3 and part of 4 are lumped together with season 2. Additionally, season 3 is actually most of season 4.Filmore and Cory in the House are missing.Looking at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\\\_of\\\\_Walt\\\\_Disney\\\\_Pictures\\\\_films](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Walt_Disney_Pictures_films), here\\'s what\\'s missing in the UK.

No Prep & Landing. Haven\\'t checked direct-to-video Disneys. Haven\\'t checked live-action shorts, but Frankenweenie is up, which is good.I wouldn\\'t expect anything \\'21-\\'29 save Steamboat Willie (though it would be nice), and it would be interesting to know why they\\'ve chosen the ones they have from the \\'30s to the \\'50s.Marvel One-Shots* A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor\\'s Hammer* Item 47* All Hail the King* (The Consultant and Agent Carter are extras in Thor and Iron Man 3)Pixar* Sparkshorts: Wind, Loop \\\\[staggered release, I assume\\\\]* Marine Life Interviews* Miss Fritter\\'s Racing Skoool* Mr. Incredible and Pals* Forky Asks A Question \\\\[staggered release, I assume\\\\]* Toy Story of Terror!* Toy Story That Time ForgotDisney 2010s* Feast* Get a Horse!* Paperman* Tangled Ever After* The Ballad of Nessie* Tick Tock TaleDisney 2000s* Glago\\'s Guest* How to Hook Up Your Home Theater* John Henry* LorenzoDisney 1990s* Roller Coaster Rabbit* Off His Rockers* Trail Mix-Up* Runaway BrainDisney 1980s* Vincent* Fun with Mr. Future* Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore* Sport Goofy in Soccermania* Oilspot and Lipstick* Tummy TroubleDisney 1960s-70s* Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree/Blustery Day/Tigger Too (obviously up in The Many Adventures, but not up individually)* NOTHING ELSE! (11 Shorts)Runaways season 3 dunno why it’s missing Agents of shield season 6 - dunno why Even Stevens series I have no idea why this is missing too nothing stoping itMalcom in the middle is not on any Disney+ (I have it on dvd anyway)I’ll Be Home for Christmas IS on Disney+ in the UK so that can be crossed off.Also missing on the UK is *Walt Disney\\'s Wonderful World of Colour: Disneyland Through the Seasons*.X-Men: Dark Phoenix, the latest movie, is also missing.High School Musical The Musical The Series episodes 2 and beyond are also missing.Its the above content missing from D+ in the Uk ?I believe the first Fantastic Four movie is missing from D+ UKThey only have Rise of the Silver Surfer & the 90s cartoon as far as I can seeAlso missing:- The Emperor’s New School (Kuzco’s Königs-Klasse)- JonasGod I am so pissed that Tale Spin (Käpt\\'n Balu) is missing in Germany, it\\'s by far my favourite 90s Disney Cartoon.I wanted to rewatch it first, then Gargoyles.Anybody know why it\\'s not available? Is it currently on some other streaming service here?\\\\-Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. season 3-6\\\\-The Mandolorian (only first two Chapters)\\\\-The same restrictions they have in the US (Netflix contracts etc)\\\\-I thought they wanted to add Luke Cage/DD/IF/JJ/Defenders etc too? Is it a contract?Also Star Wars ResistanceTalespin missing is really a pity :(An info in why Tale Spin is missing. It’s not being aired anywhere else if I’m not mistaken.Also the three most recent episodes of clone warsThe old Spider Man animated series is also missingI got disney plus just for the Hercules tv show. Gutted it\\'s not in there. I\\'ll cancel before the free trial is up.And HSMTMTS episode 2 and beyond. And the rest of the MandalorianThanks. Noted for UK.Ikr, I got Disney+, just for that reason (along with Hercules, Lloyd in Space, Brandy and Mr Whiskers).U.K. too, looking for the weekenders.I don’t think it’s finished airing in the UK yet. I saw an ad on Disney XD for the moon arcNope. Noted on the list I\\'m collating though. Thanks.It\\'s on Amazon Prime.Thanks. Noted for UK.Frozen 2 is already available in US. Each country has different titles and different times when new stuff will be addedI read that s5 was removed due to inappropriate content or sth. I was IMMENSLY disappointed about the three missing seasons and I hope they fix itWe have all 1-5 in the ukSome of the movies above listed I saw on Disney+ but didn’t click on (some I did so they must be available)That\\'s terrible news! Disney really needs to work out deals with Sony to reclaim missing pieces like Iron Man (for Spain) and Muppets Take Manhattan (for the US). if they were smart they\\'d work it into their next round of Spider-Man negotiations and attempt to secure streaming rights to the Spidey movies as well. Sony has been such a thorn in the side of Disney\\'s brand acquisitions. Paramount previously worked out a deal on the Marvel movies, hopefully they can someday be cooperative with regards to the Indiana Jones films too. I want D+ to truly be home to all the Disney franchises.The first Iron Man is available in Ireland and was originally distributed here by a Paramount.Same with season 7 of the clone warsSame here in germany. Don\\'t know why they would do that. Most people already seen it anyways.Thanks! Noted.Thanks. Noted.Not available anywhere... Yet :(Thanks. Noted.The license is still with Sky I thinkAdditionally I posted something similar to above but it was blocked for Rule 1. Mine was not just in order of arrival but also split by service. Not sure if comments also violate rule 1. Can\\'t find a way to post here with tables and grids https://www.drewsclues.tv/blog/2020/2/13/6esllmuv6wod9lx2yh0inmc86qegbgNot canon anymore so perhaps trying to sweep it under the rug... love that shit though would watch it on loop if it got added.Apparently owned by WB is the real reason. :(Thanks. Noted.What country?UK too.If it helps Pepper Ann has never been released anywhere outside it\\'s airing on TV. I really don\\'t get why Disney doesn\\'t want to release a show they fully own the rights to, not to mention it being their first cartoon series created by a woman you\\'d think that be celebrated right?In the uk and we only have Even Stevens movie but not the seriesMost of those shows aren\\'t on Disney+ at all.It\\'s on Netflix rn, so the probably have to wait until their contract with whomever will run out.Thanks. Noted.Thanks. Noted.I just found the Shorts section, it\\'s a subgenre of movies, which makes some sense. Would still probably better if they put them under the film series e.g. Silly Symphonies, rather than individually.Thanks. Noted.Please check again. I\\'ve just checked all seasons and they look ok.Idk if this applies but I know in the US at launch certain browsers would only show the first couple episodes of each season, but supposedly on the mobile app all of them were displayed. Not sure if I’m your case those episodes really are missing or if it’s just an issue with the browser. Try checking the mobile app or different browser. If you still don’t see them then they may just not be available. Certain shows have missing episodes. But I don’t think Simpson’s is one of them or at least not so many missing episodes, in the US at leastBob Iger said this is one of the titles that will never be on Disney+Thanks. Noted.same in Spain. I guess it has something to do with it still being available on Netflix?Yes, Netflix got the rights till...I\\'m not sure anymore.Nope, you can\\'t stream it anywhere in Germany. You can buy it at Amazon and if I remember correctly it was on Amazon prime, but not anymore.I love this show!Avengers Endgame and Mulan (animated) are both on Disney+. Spiderman will be stuck due to the Sony deal, nothing Disney can do there since Sony hold all distribution rights.Rise of Skywalker was released in December, it\\'s March. There\\'s no chance a blockbuster film would be released on a streaming platform within 4 months of the cinema release. Clone Wars and Mandalorian were set up as weekly released shows. Had they released full seasons in one go, there\\'s nothing stopping someone joining the free trial, finishing the series, then cancelling. Maybe spend more than 10 minutes poking around before complaining, since many of your points are either mistakes or due to outside influences.I think Star Wars rise of skywalker will not be on Disney+ till August/SeptemberI think the reason Spider-Man mcu is not on Disney+ has something to do with Sony etc2 posts removed... \"always\" is a little much.  -buttheadDifferent content has different contracts to fulfill with other services in each country. So even if a movie is available in another country, yours might not have them because in your country that movie has a contract with another service available in your country. To watch those movies you will have to subscribe to the other service or wait for it to be added to Disney+Movies still get a theatrical run and then a home media purchase run before being added to streaming so don’t expect new movies to join until around 7 months after they come out in theatres.Rise of Skywalker in particular came out in December of last year, and just barely got its home media release this month, so shouldn’t be expected on Disney+ until at least around June.A few were moved up due to the current virus situation but that is not meant to be standard going forward, at least as of now.Movies will not go from theatres straight to Disney+, especially not the big blockbusters where Disney can still make more bank from home media purchases. Disney+ will only feature content owned by entirely by Disney. even though it may share ownership or have an agreement with another company or even own the rights to a specific character, does not mean they also own the movies that character is featured inso movies like Spiderman, Incredible Hulk and Indiana Jones will not be on Disney+ for this reasonAs for the original shows. Yes it’s annoying given that other countries already have more episodes, but they’re meant to be viewed on a weekly basis as a way to keep people subscribing and not just binging it all at once and cancelling right away. Sucks yes, but it is what it is.Hopefully that clarified at least some of your queriesHaha, thanks, I just had this info in my own personal notes since Disney+ launched but there was no place for me to post it because I didn’t want it to be spam, but if this is meant to serve as a mega thread, I figured this would be the best time and place for it.It went to AMC.30 years on from the release of the greatest Disney TV show ever made and we\\'re being denied the right to watch this masterpiece in the United Kingdom....

Seems to be the case with quite a few shows :(.Was also looking forward to binging Even Stevens, but only the move is present.Thanks! I\\'d already noted Even Stevens, and *thought* I\\'d noted Agents of Shield,, but can\\'t see it. So I\\'ll add that and Runaways.Thanks!Thanks!Thanks!Thanks.

I miss the old Spiderman from the 90\\'s. I don\\'t understand why it\\'s not on Disney+ its not anywhere else. Aladdin, Hercules etc. are all Disney that doesn\\'t make any sense.Keep yourself happy with Gummy Bears in the meantime.I think the Netflix marvel shows are not made by Disney that’s why they not added. Well that’s what I thinkClone Wars (final season) has only 2 episodes as wellMake sure to tell them why at help.disneyplus.com / give feedbackJesus! I forgot that Brandy and mr whiskers existed. That’s a really funny showThanks. Noted.Not in the UK as far as I can tell. Got a link?I\\'m worried that they are going to keep their original release dates. Hopefully notDo you have a link to an article? It\\'s really a bummer.But not S6I really hope they can work out deals for all this movies. And I also thought about the Indiana Jones films recently. We\\'ll have to wait and see...Yes, Paramount also distributed the first Iron Man, Thor and Captain America, and Iron Man 2 in the U.S.A., when Disney bought Marvel, they bought also the distribution rights to the four movies (and the then future Avengers 1 and Iron Man 3) that were distributed by Paramount Pictures. But for some reason, the first Iron Man movie, here in Spain wasn\\'t distributed by Paramount, and since Disney only made a deal with Paramount, Iron Man is still distributed by Sony.I contacted the support about this:14m agoPlease hold while we connect you to the next available agent.Routing you to a live agent...Agent has entered the chat.11m agoHello, my name is Christy.Thank you for contacting Disney+ Customer Support. How may I assist you today?9m agoWhere are The Clone Wars S07E03-05?Bare with me while I check for you.7m agoDisney+ will be updating the content for The Clone Wars weekly.

I, like lot of people, have no interest in watching any of your content in German.1m agoMaybe there should be something in the profile preferences for people like meI will be sure to advise upper management of the feedback you have provided and would like to aplogise for the inconvenience.Thank you,have a nice dayjust nowyou as well. Thank you for contacting Disney+Chat session ended.It\\'s still airing on syfyThis is awesomeI was looking for something like this, but even some of this stuff changes as content is consistently always available where it is noted to be now, I’ve noticed that especially with live tv channels like tbs tnt and free form, where they’re available only for a short period and then off again.And something like Alice which is currently under nowhere, but it’s actually on tbs tnt right now. But in a few days or weeks it may be off again, just like some of the ones currently under tnt and TVs aren’t currently on there right now, but they come in a rotating fashion available for a few days, and then not available for some time and then back again for a few days.So the live tv channels do not offer consistency and they also usually include ads. Only the premium networks like HBO and Netflix and Starz seem to offer more consistency where their end date with their current services matches up with the return date for Disney+.The sad thing is just because they return to a Disney+ does not mean the will stay there, they may be removed again like Alice was, and went right back to tbs tnt for another 2 years apparently.Oh man, that stinks. I remember loving it but it\\'s really hard to come by now.oh man. So we gotta wait until Disney buys WB next year? :/A lot of shows aren\\'t on Disney+:AladdinBuzz Lightyear of Star CommandAmerican DragonHouse of MousePhil of the FutureLloyd in SpaceRaw ToonageFish Hooks101 DalmationsThe WeekendersJungle CubsThe WuzzlesThanks.

Thank youIt was on my TV\\'s app. You\\'re right, they\\'re there on the android app.And really doesn\\'t need to be.Perhaps😄But shouldn\\'t be that the reason why you want to have Disney+, so you get things early!?ah, thank youHave they said why?Another one I just noticed for the list, we have Garfield 2 but not the first one, thanks for compiling!Oops, you forgot to delete Ducktales 1987 as being missing.Total Drama Island. Currently on Netflix.That\\'s outstanding! Thanks! I\\'ve combined them into the main list I\\'m collating and segregated films and TV.I have Aladdin here in Ireland.The series for Aladdin and Hercules is indeed missing... wanted to watch those again tooThe Marvel Netflix shows were made by Disney, through Marvel Television and ABC Studios (same as all the pre D+ shows). Netflix was only the distributor and their contract said Marvel can’t use the characters until 2 years after the cancellation.Wasn\\'t there some rumors about Disney canceling new seasons to launch it on D+? I could be wrongWhat country please?Sorry maybe only GermanWhen I typed it in it said july on Disney +.https://amp.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/dbu7l7/agents_of_shield_season_5_is_gone/It\\'s a support mail some user got for asking about it. Not sure if it\\'s put in stone thou.So from what I gather episodes 3 - 5 will be available by the end of this week (?) in the UK?So what does this mean now?So after it finish airing on syfy will it be available ok Disney+ or do we have to wait a bitOh yeah I\\'ve been following all this stuff too! I check every month the databases for Starz TNT TBS AMC etc and you\\'re definitely correct. at least it gives us a slightly better idea as to when some of these fox titles that they don\\'t create landing pages for might show up... but most often when they expire they just stay in limbo until they return to another TV service or move somewhere else but at least it\\'s a start.and thank you for reminding me I need to update that post I created because since I posted it as you said Alice through the looking glass sprung up and other things like thatThanks. Noted for UK.SwitzerlandYou\\'re welcomeNot at all.The point of streaming services is not to get things as soon as they’re out of theatres.You are after all only paying one small flat monthly fee to access a whole variety of contentso if anything the streaming services are for those who don’t mind waiting rather than purchasing movies individually.Disney especially makes a lot on their theatrical runs and then their home media sales. They don’t add their movies to streaming until its been on the home media market long enough that sales have mostly stagnated.Disney is not about to give up that chunk of money from home media sales by releasing movies to Disney+ immediately. If they did, you can bet the price of Disney+ will go up to make up for those sales losses.There’s been some exceptions recently given the current world situation, but these are exceptions not the norm.It does prove that Disney Can put their movies immediately on Disney+ if they wanted to. But we all know Disney, if they can make more money out of something they absolutely will.Those who are desperate to watch a top selling movie right away will pay the theatre prices for one time view and or the purchase/rental fee once it’s out on home media.Everyone else can wait for it to be on Disney+ after a few months.We may see that time shorten the more people who commit to streaming subscriptions and keep them active instead of cancelling after a month or two, and less home media sales.If Disney sees enough revenue coming in from streaming and not enough from home media they may start releasing movies to Disney+ earlier but who knows how long that will take.I mean people still buy regular old DVDs and we’re at least 3 successors ahead now (Bluray, 4K and digital) it’s definitely not happening overnight and you can see by their choices even in this time that they are unwavering.Most people probably wouldn’t be rushing to theatres once they open up again to watch onward so they went ahead and announced early digital release.Frozen 2 had already been out on home media at least a month, gave families something new to watch at home.But Star Wars? Nowhere to be seen coming soon to Disney+ they know that Star Wars fans will buy individual home media releases and they can make more money off that.Mulan being released on Disney+ ? Don’t count on it, it’s theatrical release has only been postponed.They save Disney+ original releases for those movies they feel won’t be as successful in the theater and home media market.But anything else, if they know it can make more money, will go through all the other avenues before reaching Disney+ as it’s final resting place to access for only $7/mo, after they’ve already made millions on it from theatrical and home media sales.Thanks!No, I was just hoping to sit down with the episode list and double-check then first. ;-)Thanks.No problem! I missed [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\\\\_Jungle\\\\_Book\\\\_(1994\\\\_film)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jungle_Book_(1994_film)) because who knew Disney had made so many Jungle Books?The 101 Dalmatians show is also missing.What about the Jungle Book TV series?So the marvel Netflix shows will be on Disney+ but not till 2021 or is it two years after they been cancelled or two years from when Disney+ startedI think the rumor was that Netflix canceled the shows in retaliation to Disney+ starting. Like it didn’t make sense for them (Netflix) to make shows based on Disney’s ip when Disney started a direct competitor.I never heard thatSwitzerlandNo worries.

Also, Good **Mourning** Mickey! is a VERY different kind of show.Which is BS, The Simpsons is pretty adult so are the MCU movies.Double dipping.I’m saying this for months now already. I’m sure this is how they’ll gonna do it.I have been using the app on PS4 all day and not had any issues. What sort of bugs are you talking about? The Simpsons thing does bother me but I have read they are working on it so I\\'ll can watch other things whilst I\\'m waiting. Not noticed any real bugs so farFor you guys saying it\\'s because the EU network restrictions, two things:\\\\- There\\'s a lot of other content in Disney + that is 4K (like OP said, the other Star Wars, all of Marvel, some Pixar, etc). And it works, I have confirmed it.\\\\- The restriction limits BITRATE not RESOLUTION. This applies to Netflix, Disney +, HBO, whatever.**To OP**: in Spain it\\'s also only HD (as most of Pixar as well, sadly), I have no idea why, I just hope they fix this small issues soon and they make the 4K versions available soon.It\\'s in 4K Dolby Vision here in the UK, so hopefully, that means it can be fixed quickly in other countries.I\\'m form Spain and I was wondering the same thing but in my case Solo it\\'s also in HD like Rogue one while the rest are in 4k hdr vision etc.I think that\\'s because 4K streaming may have been disabled for European territories (for now)All the streaming services have lowered quality temporarily in Europe to ease bandwidth.How did you confirm it? I want to check myselfI can watch other Films in 4K HDR without a problemWithout entering into too much details, if you have an Apple TV and a Mac, you can toggle ATV\\'s streaming debug logs, which shows the bitrate and resolution of whatever you\\'re watching on the device, that\\'s how I checked it.[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41662691/how-do-i-enable-the-developer-menu-in-settings-for-apple-tv-4th-gen](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41662691/how-do-i-enable-the-developer-menu-in-settings-for-apple-tv-4th-gen)Disney + on Europe, for supported content, works at 4K/Dolby Vision etc, the EU just reduced the bitrate.I wonder if this affects the U.K.? I’m gonna try this on my Mac. I don’t have an Apple TVYea they told us this weeks ago.Same for Austria.Another bad thing Even Stevens is missing I loved that show when I was younger (I am 25 now)The movie is on but not the showSame in SpainAnyone know why DuckTales Season 2 isn\\'t on here?A lot of sensible comments being downvoted by the Disney hivemind... Seems to me like they\\'re only punishing those who willingly waited until the official UK release, anybody else will have already seen the full first season.Not ideal but This Is The WayI have a question. Why was there a wait for the UK?I seen it all but the main heading thing says chapter 1 and chapter 2 available I was going to watch it again as I last seen it when it last aired in USA[removed][removed]Do what I\\'m doing and start Clone Wars. By time you are done Mandalorian might all be out by then. If not, there\\'s some good Marvel series too.[removed]I would imagine its to get you to use the 7 day free trial and then purchase the month/year after they\\'re out.aye i agree, i cancelled my sub the following morning because of this.the content is only going to be Disney, how fast can they churn out content and how fast is this going to dry up. i honestly dont think ill sub for long periods. They are losing subs trying to keep people subbed for a longer period. Great Job!It would of taken me a couple of weeks to watch these anyway and you would of earned some beer tokens of me. yes i squeak when i walk.Company offering a free 7-day trial of their streaming service doesn’t want people to watch all of their shows for free and not then continue to subscribe when the trial ends? What a shocker!If all the episodes are gonna be up eventually then what’s the point in delaying it? People can still take a 7 day trial when all episodes are up?I mean Disney has to make money somehow. If they just released everything all at once people only interested in The Mandalorian will only get the free trial binge it all and not renew the subscription.Frozen 2 is not available either.It is staggered to prevent people signing up for 7 day trial and watching the whole series.At least I get to see it now. I’m used to waiting a lot longer than this. I was only going to watch one episode at a time anyway.What a joke, imagine waiting all this time and then having to wait for weekly episodes, wonder if there is anyway to access the US catalog.I’m ok with that. “Traditional” TV is usually one or two episodes a week anyway.It\\'s so stupid, launching something this big in only a few selected regions was already stupid but pretending it\\'s a weekly event now to artificially extend it\\'s lifetime is even more stupid. I\\'ve already watched it all so not a huge deal , plenty of other stuff to keep me busyHow long do we have to wait?The service has only been available for 33min, and already i\\'m angry. No reason why they can\\'t give us all the episodes straight away.Is this available on the us version?Because someone in disney is greedy as duckShut upThe service was not available in the UK.**Please read this entire message**---> Your comment on r/DisneyPlus was removed due to a Rule 2 violation: \"No posts about piracy or VPNs.\" ---**If you believe this post was removed by mistake, please [contact the Moderators.](https://reddit.com/message/compose/?to=r/disneyplus&subject=Question%20About%20A%20Removal)****Violations may result in a temporary or permanent ban.****Please read this entire message**---> Your comment on r/DisneyPlus was removed due to a Rule 2 violation: \"No posts about piracy or VPNs.\" ---**If you believe this post was removed by mistake, please [contact the Moderators.](https://reddit.com/message/compose/?to=r/disneyplus&subject=Question%20About%20A%20Removal)****Violations may result in a temporary or permanent ban.**Are all seasons of clone wars on Disney +?**Please read this entire message**---> Your submission on r/DisneyPlus was removed due to a Rule 2 violation: \"No posts about piracy or VPNs.

Probably going to do what someone else suggested and just get stuck into the clone wars until it\\'s all outBecause not everyone is willing to do that and many will sign up for the two months to watch weekly, and some of those will just never get round to cancelling their membership. It\\'s all just extra memberships.But then all people have to do is wait for the whole show to be released then take out the free trial.Bit of an indictment of their service that they don\\'t think their other content will keep people around.I think it\\'s so that people don\\'t take the 7 day trial, binge watch the mandalorian and then end the subscriptionThis wasn’t a secret. Disney made it clear that they were adopting a 1 episode per week format to keep viewers engaged for two months rather than two days.It\\'s the same deal with the clone wars season 7With everything going on in the would you’re angry about THIS?Grow up, it’s a TV show. You’ll get to see the whole thing in a few weeks.They were clear that this was the case.Wait until you find out we don’t get season 2 until this time next yearWhy is this guy getting annihilated? People on this sub really support the billionaire company’s anti consumer tactics? Or is there a lot of astroturfing going onYou kids really are the generation of instant gratification, aren\\'t you?They said licensing issuesWhat isEven Stevens is available on Disney + in the US, both the show and movie.Yes but why was it not available?Seasons 1 to 7 with 7 doing what Mandalorian is doing I think. I\\'ve not seen a single episode so I am starting from the beginning.Indeed, good point. People just want everything yesterday these days. Which is sort of understandable with the way streaming services work, Netflix in particular.I’m definitely gonna watch clone wars, I’ve seen about the first 3-4 seasons but never got the rest watched, years ago. So I’m going to start at the beginning and binge as much as I can.It\\'s not like there will be any FOMO since the show has been out elsewhere for months.If that\\'s the case, then people would just wait until it\\'s all released to sign up for the free trial.That\\'s the price you should pay for thinking such a long delay between America and Europe is still acceptable in the 21st century.There\\'s a massive difference though between doing a weekly format for a show premiering and intentionally restricting content that is already accessible in its entirety in most countries. Just because they said they were doing this months ago doesn\\'t make it any better.In my opinion this is only done because Disney+ is lacking original content and with The Mandalorian as their biggest headliner they don\\'t want to risk it. I see the intention but when Disney+ has already taken so long to get here its bullshit. I\\'ve got a few friends doing the free trial and would be tempted to keep subscribing so I\\'ll just tell show them streaming sites that already have the episodes available.Season 2 will be delayed like falcon and the winter solider will be and WandaVision all because of coronavirusNo reason why that would happen.Season 1 released at the same time in America and Netherlands. There won’t be a release delay for season 2, which is scheduled for October (but will probably be pushed to Nov. or Dec.)What licensing issues? The mandalorian is a Disney+ show and is not available anywhere else.Proper excuse that lol.The original series I meanEven Steven\\'sSky owned the distribution rights for Star Wars until March this year due to a contract agreed pre-2015. Rather than waiting until everyone could watch The Mandalorian, Disney went ahead and released it in America leaving us behind for 6 months. Spoilers everywhere and now they’re now giving us the full season? It’s really a joke at this point, how much of a priority America gets. Even with Netflix they have so much more content for the same price as what we pay. They’ve got ALL the Indiana Jones movies, what do we have? “Raiders! The story of the greatest fan film ever made”. And for D23 Expo, anyone who attended got a 2 year free subscription for Disney+, but only if you’re a US resident. How is this fair? Most Americans who attend Disney Expo can afford to and with ease, while European fans are paying thousands to fly over and attend - they can’t be included in that offer? Companies don’t care about anyone who isn’t AmericaThe service? Probably due to licensing for getting content on the service.Sky contract limiting when they could launch a competitorNah mate, people just want stuff at the same time as the rest of the world.True but then they\\'d have to wait even longerDoubt it as they already finished filming it.Yes I know, was just trying to make him even more angrier while im waiting for it to launch on my Samsung tvI don’t work at Disney but that’s what they said.Are u asking if even Stevens is on us version of Disney plusWhen has it ever worked that way though? It would be nice if it did but people are reacting like it was totally unexpected and we always get stuff the same time as the USA.And keep in mind that they want as many people using the service as long as they can. If they don’t do that, then the only real subscribers are gonna be parents whose child wants to watch Frozen on a continuous loop.How could they have finished it if they just cast Ashoka?Ah I seeAny luck with that Bud?No they didn’t...YeahI mean these days we do on the streaming services, or at most it may be a day or two lateNo it’s just come out they’ve cast her. Filming finished earlier this month.I have the uk version as I am from the uk but when I searched even Stevens Disney plus on google the first search is for the actual Disney plus site and if I click it it will open the app and looks to try and load even Stevens but gives me error thing So maybe it is on us version but because I am on uk one it gives me error as it is not on the uk one yetI\\'m guessing it\\'ll be two episodes a week or people would binge and ditch it.The best guess going around is that they’re staggering out the major shows on a weekly schedule in order to encourage those on a free trial to pay for a few months going forward. Not ideal, but at least the starting archive is pretty robust, in my opinion.This is such bs honestly... I waited to watch the series for the official release here and that\\'s how they thank me (us?)... In times of covid19 and the series beeing out for months this is a dick move... specially to the people who preordered a years worth :/It\\'s exactly this. Clone wars will have two episodes a week until it catches up to the US. Mando will have a new episode on Fridays.Yeah, while school is off I’m just going to binge watch the whole MCU 😂This has been pretty common knowledge for quite some time. If it surprised you, then you’ve not been reading much on the internet about the European launch of Disney+.Okay thanks.Don\\'t suppose you have a source for this? Makes sense if this is the case, at least then we\\'ll be caught up by Siege of Mandalore time.Too bad the Spiderman movies aren\\'t on there due to Sony not giving them permissionI honestly don\\'t have an official source I\\'ve just been going on what other people have been saying in other posts and across other platforms.It’s fine, I will just watch them online somehowAh okay no worries, hopefully it\\'s right then!Shhh, don\\'t mention any of the bad stuff under rule 2, or you will be Silenced\\\\_Chaos\\\\_Found this https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a31783698/disney-plus-uk-launch-mandalorian-episodes-release/Well, he doesn\\'t need to, if he has an account to another streaming service that\\'s available to UK customers that happens to have the Spiderman movies...Starts with N and ends in ow TvWelcome to our subscribers from Spain!EnjoyDo we know if/when the 1990\\'s Spider-Man and X-Men cartoons are going to be added to the Spanish version?Are the full 3 seasons of Ladybug available in Spanish?NiceI have mixed feelings tbh as The Mandalorian is not complete, only the first 2 episodes are available and the rest will release weekly which doesn’t make sense to me at all. Frozen 2 is not available either and says it’ll release 10th July. Dumbo and Aladdín 2019 are not available either. When I contacted support to ask a couple of questions they said that we would find surprises in the release, I didn’t think they’d be this kind of surprises :_(Any idea when the app\\'s and web Will be working?

I remember searching for it and several people agreed that it\\'s too dark. I ould watch Avengers on the Disney plus app and Amazon prime and the night scenes were unwatchable on Disney. I think you\\'re only choice is  to watch through  a device not directly through the app.Hope they fix this. The details are so crisp and sharp on the Star Wars films but the colour correction looks off and dark scenes are way too dim. Netflix doesn\\'t have this problem.Unwatchable for me :(How can this even be a thing for a premium subscription service in 2020?Funny enough it was Black Panther, lots at the start set at night, can’t see anything. Then Toy Story 4 at the start is set at night on the rain, really really dark.Thanks for responding man. That’s not ideal at all...In [ ]:4K content is showing up just fine on my Sony TV. I tested it with A New Hope earlier. Just to be clear, I\\'m in the UK.I\\'m in the UK and 4K/Dolby Vision Content is working fine for me on my Fire Cube and the app on my LG TV.What year was your LG TV made?(Atmos 5.1.2 sound isn\\'t working on my Fire Cube)Exactly the same. Tried Android, PS4, Firestick and Samsung TV. It\\'s beyond frustrating. Have a 200mbps connection with Virgin.Edit I tried a TV that was hardwired and it worked.I\\'m having the same problem no 4K with an Xbox One X even though my monitor is 4K. I\\'m starting to think that Disney Plus doesn\\'t have a 4K stream only a 4K HDR10 meaning that anything 4K without HDR10 is getting defaulted to HD.Bought it 2 years ago, it\\'s a uh610v but not sure exact date of manufactureHey there, my Xbox one x started to show 4k hdr10 content, without me having to do anything to it so I\\'m wondering if it\\'s bandwidth related in the sense that the app is erroneously identifying bandwidth especially as my LG TV, which the Xbox is connected to, shows hdr10 hd for same content that is 4k on Xbox, through the dedicated TV app.Quote From Disney Help ;-\"We are aware of an issue in where if your device detects \\'4K HDR 30Hz\\', the Disney+ channel will currently deliver standard HD resolution. If your TV supports it, try changing the display resolution to 4K HDR 60Hz in Settings>Display type to receive 4K HDR content.\"What does your Xbox say in the \"4K TV details\" in its TV and Display options in the settings. I\\'ve gotYour TV supports 4K UHD 60hzYour TV supports 4K 10bit 24hzYour TV supports 4K 10bit 50hzYour TV supports 4K 10bit 60hzYour TV setup does not support HDR10 video. Content will not be shown in HDR.Your TV doesn\\'t support Dolby Vision.Sorry for being a pain asking but it would really help me narrow down if its a HDR or a bandwidth issue.Thanks for that, just checked to see only option is HDMI to set @60hz which is already enabled, maybe it\\'s a kink in the tv app. Anyway just rechecked Xbox one x and there is now 4k content, just not on the tv.No worries, all the same except for HDR10, mine is supportedThank you.I\\'ve just got in touch with Disney Plus support and yes, 4K without HDR isn\\'t supported.Thanks for letting me know, I feel like Disney should\\'ve mentioned this being the case surely a 4k set-up should display as that regardless of HDRThat\\'s what I would of thought too, annoyingly Netflix, Amazon Prime, You Tube, 4K UHD Blu Rays and Xbox games all do that and display at 4K without HDR. All I can hope for is that Disney one day make it happen on there end.Thanks for helping though.No worriesThis has been discussed in this sub, as well as on the rest of the internet: the rest of the episodes will be added periodically, most likely weekly.I\\'m in Ireland and I\\'m just as annoyed about as youHaven’t seen those, posted this straight after watching the episodesI waited 4 bloody months now I have to wait even longer why the hell is it delayedSomebody didn\\'t read the T&C\\'s 🤷🏾\\u200d♀\\u200dYou have to get a parent or someone who is not you to call and either get a refund or transfer funds, both are still unlikely as you broke the T&C\\'s which you agreed toWhen I made my Disney account, I set the year to 1998, so I\\'m 22 according to Disney though I\\'m actually 15.Once again, if you read the T&C\\'s you don\\'t get a refund as you\\'ve had it for a day and have presumably used itIt\\'s tough luck dude. You can try and try your hardest, but you have to get another person to do it for youThanks for the replies. Will get one of my parents to call them.Its the 26th today call em up againWhile this is true to a certain extent, Disney is notoriously good with refunds. Don’t sweat it OP. Have a parent or guardian contact Disney+ and it should get straightened out pretty quickly. (phone call usually works better, not sure if that’s available).Yeah People should note this only matters though if you have a pre existing Disney account with your correct age on the same email you use to register for D+.Somebody on here had their account blocked for the same reason (though their birthday year was incorrect massively and not what he set it) and did not get anything backI can’t guarantee it, but I’ve never had an issue with Disney refunds, especially if it was legally a child who purchased it. I’ve refunded things and Disney services that are “no refund” when I calmly and respectfully explain the situation to a representative.If someone else that’s underage on reddit couldn’t get a refund, it’s likely because they don’t have the account credentials, or that they require a parent who possesses the billing information.At the very least, OP will have their account granted to them, but switched to a parent account. Then OP just needs to make a profile under their parents account.Terms and Conditions are meant to protect the company, not scam their customers.Same in Germany, we only get German for Avatar.What is this weirdness? I mean, obviously the different language audio exists?It\\'s the same in all European countries: France gets only French, Italy only Italian, Germany only German, etc.Pretty annoying.That exactly what I thought! Like, I know the audios exist! Glad to know someone is frustrated like me hahaWow, that\\'s a reason to unsubscribe.yep and a lot of titles are missing a ton of languages.... my wife ia french and we live in germany... a lotnof stuff are missing French audio and/or subtitlesYep. I do speak German but we also have people here whose English is better than their German... I thought it would be normal nowadays to be able to watch a movie in the language it was produced in.Then, on the other hand, many American companies can\\'t imagine things that are normal for us here in Europe (like the high number of multilingual people and the good proficiency in English) . In fact, my job is partly making sure that cultural differences don\\'t get in the way of my companies business :D - but something like it should not happen to Disney ...There\\'s a section in movies that are filtered for 4k and ultra hdJust watched moana and i found it impressive in 4k.I give it a go some of the marvel4K looks a tad dark.Where is this section? I couldn’t see it.How do you find this? Looked on Android, Samsung, Fire and PS4[Android ](https://i.imgur.com/q3kOXJm.jpg) go to movies and hit the filter and select ultra hd, on my Samsung tv it\\'s the same go to movies and all the way to the right it says 4k and ultra hd. (At work so cant take a pic)If you can stream Atmos from Netflix and Amazon Prime, then the problem is obviously on Disney\\'s end. If there was any problem with your setup, you would not be able to successfully stream Atmos on Netflix and Prime.As for Disney\\'s statement ... what a load of bollocks that it has been available since November 12, 2019. I was told the same thing for my platform (nvidia shield), but I didn\\'t actually get Atmos feeds until a few weeks ago.Disney has mishandled Atmos from the start. You just have to wait for them to get their house in order.Which is crazy because it\\'s DISNEY! You\\'d think with the year plus of testing that they would have figured this out. Plus the fact that they\\'ve known about these issues for four months now...what does this meanThank you! I couldn\\'t find it :DI believe with the ongoing COVID-19 crisis Disney+ has limited its video quality as to not overload the internet infrastructure.Its showing as 4k HDR on the Fire Stick in UK. What device are you using? And do any other movies show up as 4k? (To test this check any of the Star Wars or Marvel movies)On my phone it works in 4k for now, but that could change in the near future becazse of Covid-19. I am also from GermanySee previous posts on the **bandwidth limitations** within the EU due to COVID-19.Yes other movies like endgame or the old Disney classics like Aladdin running at Dolby Vision/4KI’m using a LG C8Yeah I already thought about that to. And then again I remembered reading an article of frozen 2 that Germany won’t receive the 4K HDR version. And because the fact that we also won’t get the 4K HDR Version of the first movie in Germany... well anyway thanks for the answers ☺️The streaming quality has been reduced in Europe to reduce the strain of the impact of high internet usage[https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/24/with-lower-bandwidth-disney-opens-streaming-service-in-uk-ireland-5-other-european-countries-france-to-come-online-april-7/](https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/24/with-lower-bandwidth-disney-opens-streaming-service-in-uk-ireland-5-other-european-countries-france-to-come-online-april-7/)An article as a source for this. At the request of the EU, all quality has been throttled.but.. is it normal that linux has lower quality than windows?Windows have 720 quality, that is too low for my personal opinion, but in linux IS WORSE with 480p ADSL playback of 10 years ago... ( I have fiber)I feel like there is a problem with linux support for disney...In the Netherlands Gummi Bears has 6 seasons. It supports Deutsch as well as English audio but only English subtitles.Don’t know if it is the same for Germany but it most likely isOn D+Germany it has six (6) seasons and has English, Deutsch and a number of other languages and as pointed out already English subtitles only.Thank you :)Funny thing I’ve forgot about that series being on Disney+. It doesn’t show up anywhere under series, not under kids not under all. I had to actively search for it to find it. Wonder how many more shows are affected by this bug.Great. With this I can start my subscription :)Indeed, I had to find it by searching. I guess there will be a few bugs and bits to sort as it all settles in.I have the feeling that when watching older shows, more older shows show up in the homescreen.Once found through search bar it’s under Animations.Four devices can stream simultaneously per accountYou can have your account signed into up to 10 devices (I’m already up to 5) and 4 devices can be using the account at the same time.4 devices refer to how many devices can be playing Disney+ at the same time.It\\'s normal.

If you cancel before the free trial is up, you shouldn\\'t be charged at all. If you are even a day late, though, you will be charged, and will have access for the rest of the billing cycle (there is no refund given, unless it\\'s for extraordinary circumstances).NoNope. You don\\'t get logged in , just cast. It\\'s like using an HDMIIt seems that Disney+ changed the rules regarding the 10 devices (or clarified what they initially meant). Basically, when you log into an 11th device, you will just have to relog in again to one of the previous devices.This is a known issue that also appears in other countries: only localised video is currently available.

I think some titles do, others don‘t. Sucks tbh but at least we always have English and German to choose from :/thats a reason to unsubscribe to be honest... Disney titles on a disney platform should have all languages.... Avatar just have German language in germany no Englisch audio or subtitles... half of the classics are missing the french language... this is ridiculous in 2020...I agreeYou can start the necessary process yourself. It\\'s explained in  German support of Telekom[Telekom hilft](https://telekomhilft.telekom.de/t5/Telefonie-Internet/Disney-Plus-Keine-Email-Klickanleitung-zur-Selbsthilfe/m-p/4464546)Probably. A Coco Special is coming to the service as an a original soo there\\'s nothing. No streaming services have that.Also why would you not want your kids watching Endgame? Just a curious question it\\'s a great superhero filmIt\\'s great, and I was struggling to find a non-appropriate one. But I wouldn\\'t take a 5yo to the cinema to watch it (though equally I wouldn\\'t leave a 5yo alone to watch TV for more than 10 minutes anyway!)Just seems pointless having profiles which mean I have to give out my username and password to all my family.

Any ideas please??My friend who is on iPhone is unable to see the cast button in the app, yet it works for his other apps like Yotube, Netflix etc? I can see the cast button fine on my android. Anyone know what this could be?Atmos seems to be a problem in the countries where it launched today, same as it was in the US. I don\\'t know whether they ever fixed it.Is chromecast registered as a device or only the device that cast the data?Probably going to be a lot of 4K/UHD chat today. How is there a way to find the content on Amazon Fire? Whenever I go to details of a film it lists that 4K UHD is available but only seems to play in HDHelp! I\\'ve preordered Disney+ one month ago. I never received any email, only my bank\\'s text message confirming payment.Today Disney+ is launching: if I try to login with my email it says an account with that address doesn\\'t exist, and if I try to sign-up it asks me to start a 7-day trial and then pay. Obviously tech support is swamped.How do I proceed?I mentioned it several times before but this seems the right place to ask the question again; why is there no HDR / Dolby Vision on my Philips Android TV (pus7304, latest updates and Android version). It worked before but I can\\'t tell when this stopped working...So, the Disney app appears in the LG Content Store, but the installation always fails. Does anyone have this issue too, or know why it happens? The model of my TV is UH610V.I can’t see it on my LG content store, does  that mean it’s just not loaded on yet, or my TV is incompatible?Issues when using D+ on my Amazon FireTV stick, anyone got similar problems?Literally can\\'t watch anything on it, let\\'s me log in, select something I want to watch and then just goes to a grey/black screen but the play and pause buttons are all still there and stuff? It\\'s strange and I can\\'t find a fix anywhereSo i signed up on pc with some trouble but it works but when i try to log on mobile it says complete subscription despite being able to watch it on pc, is there a way to fix this?Anyone having problems where the video speeds up (as if being fast forwarded) for a few seconds? (This is on the PS4 app - watching Clone Wars. It’s happened in a few episodes so far.)Is it possible to change the main profile?This is not an especially important one but has anyone else figured out how to get the Star Wars crawls to be in English when English is selected as audio? This is in Germany. All the audio is English as set but the crawls are all German. Not a big issue but we want original text.Chromecast audio delay. The audio gets more and more delayed as the stream goes on. Anyone got a fix for this? I\\'m assuming it\\'s the classic Netflix Surround Sound delay which is fixed by changing to stereo but theres no option for this on Disney plus.I have been having streaming issues on PlayStation 4 the last couple of days. Today it gives the cant connect to Disney plus. Previous days a movie would play for a couple minutes or less before getting kicked off. Netflix and online gaming have no problem.Downloaded D+ on my Firestick, but every time I try to open the app, it goes to a black screen for 10 seconds, then back to the firestick home screen. Anyone know how to fix this?The Disney plus app allows you to change your email / password on the app itself without email authentication. What the hell is this? Are we in 2005? This is surely a massive security issue if someone got my password.work ps4 pro with HDR in app Disney+??I have a to firestick. If I go on any 4K content it appears pink on screen. I assume this is HDR but I have setting on firestick so HDR isn\\'t enabled. Does this app force HDR?Hey guys, just got Disney plus in uk. This is gonna sound horrible but here it goes I have a luxor smart tv with no way of getting any apps on it due to me having no aerial (needs to be tuned in and connected to internet in order for me to get apps ) in my bedroom. But it is connected to the internet. Just not tuned in and I can watch Netflix on it but I cant download any other apps including BBC iplayer and all 4 ect and Disney plus So is they\\'re anyway of casting to the tv from my phone or is that a no go for now?Hi there, i am using  modelo : LG 49UJ634V 49\" LED IPS UltraHD 4K  i managed to install the app. however the app hangs after watching a content.the only way to recover is to switch off the TV and on it back.Using the latest WEBOS for the TV.So DisneyPlus just got released in the UK and I have just realised the amount of 4k content, however when i look on the details..it says HDR10, HD. Why isn\\'t 4k showing up? I have a compatible monitor.I also realised HDR really makes the movie/show dark and unsaturated. Compared by watching a scene from Incredibles 2 on my phone and on a TV. Anyone else with this issue?I can\\'t connect to disney plus on android phone or firestick over wifi but it works over mobile data. It works fine over wifi through chrome on my laptop so not sure what\\'s going on.Made a thread about it, but I\\'ll repost here.Trying to download the Disney Plus app through either he play store or amazon store results in a \"Device is not compatible\" error using a Note 8 with official firmware.I can use the app fine when side loaded but would like the easy updates.EDIT: I may have found why its claiming to be incompatible. I learnt about a SafetyNet check which from downloading an app, seems to indicate my phone fails.I\\'m really not sure what I have done recently that could have caused it. My only thought is a recent security firmware update.. which Samsung has broke if this is the cause. I have found that Netflix and Google pay are both incompatible too and I recall installing them fine from the play store and using them recently.EDIT 2: FOUND A FIX! So if you go to developer options in settings and for me I had OEM Unlock set to on. I changed it off, restarted phone and then deleted cache/data for play store/services and restarted again and Disney + finally up for install! Hope it helps anyone! I have never touched this setting and suspect the latest security update I had may have changed this to on.Hi all,I\\'m in the UK and have a Nvidia Shield (2017) Android TV, version 8.0.2(32.5.205.105).

Played everything so far with no trouble at all. Sorry I can\\'t offer advice but just an FYI to say its working fine here.Uninstalled and reinstalled the app and that fixed it.anybody?  Plezzzzwhen work hdr in ps4 for Disney+?UPDATE: Disney + is now available for download!That sheds all the light on the subject, thank you!but.. is it not to much to lower the resolution to 480p in linux and in windows put it at 720p? we are receiving lower resolution than dvd or a bad film downloaded throug torrent... I feel like not normal.. netflix gives 1080p at 2 Mbps bitrateOh come on...like the few kbit Atmos adds are going to crash the Internet...😬😬😬That was exactly it, thanks.It\\'s not available on the hotfix version as far as I can tellWhat version number is the hot fix?32.5.205.112 so this doesn\\'t match the other version. In fact, reading the release notes again it explicitly states Disney plus isn\\'t supported. Oh well, I guess I\\'ll have to wait for the next version 8.0.3 before I can then download!How do you get the hotfix releases?I also saw another technical post by Nvidia that said some hotfix releases were currently not supported.Might be worth downgrading if possible.You can\\'t downgrade unfortunately. But here is the link: https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/shield-tv/9/340245/20152017-shield-experience-upgrade-802-hotfix-imag/That’s the standard viewing limit for the watchlist. Your titles are still on the watch list, but they are stacked on top of one another. Whenever you remove one title,another title appears in its place. It’s a dumb feature imo.I remember Mighty Med, that show was so cool. Damn brings back some memories for sure.Where do you live?Having the same issue in Germany on Sony Android TV.It starts for a second as Dolby digital and the jumps back to stereo.Is this really an issue caused by throttled bandwidth?I live in Australia.I have the exact same problem and I just talked with someone in the chat and it seems this person doesn\\'t know but said it could be because of the throttled bandwidth. Person in the chat told me she would pass it through.In some European countries they are reducing streaming bandwidth to reduce the strain on network infrastructure during the COVID-19 pandemic. I don’t know about Australia but this could be the reason. You need more bandwidth to stream surround so they may be limiting it.Awaiting the answer.Thanks so far.It doesn\\'t seem to be the case, I used Pure mode and it works for 2 seconds, then it\\'s back to stereo.Australia is not in Europe my friend...Anyhow... I subscribed (Italy) 2 days ago and I\\'m having the same problem: app is in a Xiaomi Mibox 4s where Netflix a d Prime work in 5.1 but Disney+ only in stereo. Funny is that if I use this smartphone app thru Chromecast I can get 5.1I just tried it through the Xbox One X and the 5.1 sound works. Maybe because of the HDMI / ARC cable.I think it\\'s an ANDROID TV app problem.Plenty of users with Sony TVs are having this problem.I have a Xiaomi Mibox 4s and have this problem.If instead I use the smartphone app thru the Chromecast built into my Xiaomi I get 5.1 sound.Tried 4 different times the customer support, phone and chat, Italian and English, all to no avail: they are poor guys who barely know what Dolby means.Been flooding Disney\\'s Italian Facebook page but they keep on saying to call support.On Twitter they don\\'t even reply.Now I moved to LinkedIn. It happen the same for me in Italy. Actually when I start the streaming, the sound start very good with high quality and then after a few moments, it automatically switch to stereo. I\\'ve read something regarding the fact that to face the COVID-19 emergency they lowered the bandwidth available and so on also the streaming quality. Maybe this is the cause but I cannot have an official answer about.  In the meantime I\\'ve tried every setting combination on my TV and AMP without success :(  I tried also to stream the movie with my phone on the TV but I have integrated Chromecast and I don\\'t know if it is the same using an external chromecast.  No luck anyway...still everything in stereo :(I tried setting Direct listening mode, through optical it works for two seconds, then reverts to the same behaviour again. I assume the pc would work now.Ciao Jean.I\\'m Italian as well and can confirm it\\'s not a covid reason.What is you exact setup? Do you use the Disney+ app.on tv or on an external box?I have a Xiaomi Mibox 4s with integrated Chromecast:- if I use the Disney+ Android tv app directly on the Mibox, sound is stereo, but Netflix is 5.1, so it\\'s not a setup problem but a Disney+ app problem-if I use the Disney+ smartphone app on my phone streaming through the Mibox integrated Chromecast, sound is 5.1, so it\\'s not a covid issue otherwise I\\'d get stereo also through ChromecastAmerican Disney+ support confirmed me yesterday it\\'s a Mibox known issue.I use Disney as App on May Android TV. No external box.The strange this is that actually everything is working correctly and streaming in 5.1 for one or two seconds then the AMP switch in stereo automatically.The connection between TV and Amp is with optical audio cable.I\\'ve tried every setting possible on my TV for the audio output but no luck. My AMP is compatible with Dolby Digital and DTS. No problem with Netflix and Prime.I have found this from the assistance page:https://help.disneyplus.com/csp?id=csp_article_content&sys_kb_id=2737dab3dba78cd8b1e6c28d13961955If your amplifier supports only DD and not DD+ then this could be the problem. All streaming services use DD+ but if they encode it wrongly the receiver may not be able to extract the DD core from the DD+ signal.They announced it was coming. No news though for months.At some point down the road. It was one of the devices shown as what they plan to bring it to during the D23 presentation last year.I\\'m sure it\\'s a possibility. Before Disney+ came out,  I remember reading that it wouldn\\'t be made available on Samsung TVs at launch. That changed. I\\'m sure if Netflix is on the Switch,  D+ will make it eventually.I know for the UK we don’t have Netflix on the switch the only video platform we have is YouTubeAnd huluWe don\\'t have Hulu (legally) in the UK.Ahh i didn\\'t notice it said UKSame here in Germany. Same problemSame in the uk I want to set it up for family in the kitchen and living room area I have it on my iPhone and Xbox one Not checked the 360 yetSame here in Spain, I was going crazy thinking I was alone in this lolYeah, same. Samsung Q7F, all I can find is Disney Life.Probably have to wait a few hours. The iOS app released immediately though.I have the android app on my phone, Samsung TV only shows Disney life app currently.Still doet see it on my rokuNow available in UK for my Samsung TVTry looking at app preview at content section(from another Redditor)Downloaded on IOS first thing no issues, does not appear on NowTV stick or Samsung TV..... what’s the point if I can only watch it on my phone?!?A fix until it comes out on the Samsung smart TV it to stream your phone display to your TV and then play the content you want on your phoneAny fix?Might be we just need to wait till later on in the day thenThe Xbox one app didHow thoughMight show up as an ad. That’s how I found it.It released later that morning. Came up on my ads.PS4 was up immediately tooNot sure if it is going to be on 360 or notreally wolverine origins is here  in IrelandWait, do you have Logan?Also in Spain, we miss Apocalypse and Dark Phoenix (and R-rated films)Origins is here for the uk tooWeirdWell except that obviously since it is R ratedWe just have to wait for something like Unogs for DisneyplusMaybe it\\'s not on there because of the FSK 16 rating it got in Germany?Oh, maybe I didn\\'t know that always thought it was FSK 12Disney doesn’t support ATMOS on all platforms. I am not current on which ones but I’m sure you google it.They don\\'t support it on xbox one either, very annoying!Give details on your set up. Might make it easier to diagnose the issue.I have the same problem. I get dolby vision but no atmos. LG 65 inch B9 with samsung hw q90r dolby atmos soundbar. Tried with the soundbar and without it(using atmos internal TV speakers), the same result, no dolby atmos only dolby vision.Germany: No atmos on Apple TV 4k. Works in Netflix and iTunes. Maybe Disney disabled Atmos because of the corona bandwidth limitation?Researched a bit and most people say it\\'s due to bandwith restrictions due to Covid-19 pandemic.From what I have found so far, Disney+ currently doesn\\'t output Atmos on any platform in Europe. No idea why...Sorry. I have LG SL10YG 5.1.2 soundbar with SPK8-S wireless 2.0 rear speakers.Yes. Search this sub for more info.In [ ]:Season 3 of Raven\\'s Home is still airing on Disney Channel. It won\\'t be on Disney Plus until 1-2 months after the season finale airs.Amphibia is on in the US but may not be in the UK. Ask about the licensing to customer service. Big hero 6 season 2 is due later in april in the states but again not sure about licensing in the UK.As for Bluey? It’s innocent, it’s charming and it’s cute. There is absolutely nothing wrong with watching kids being kids and their families being adorable together. Enjoy it 😊Season 2 of Big Hero 6 dropped today.Yep just got the answer its unavailable for us atm. Not sure why. As an adult did you have fun with bluey? Secondly have you seen tangled the series?In uk? Only showing S1 for meI had fun with it. It’s not groundbreaking or anything. It’s just a relaxing show about kids and their family. It’s clearly targeted towards the youngest age group but that should never stop someone from checking it out and finding something they enjoy in it. I love watching families being adorable like this cause it’s something I wanna have one day and I’d like to have a baseline of what I can dream about or incorporate one day.As for tangled? It looks amazing but can be hit or miss especially in season 2 which I still haven’t finished. It’s a really good show that simply stumbles a bunch like a baby deer lol.At the moment, Big hero, Amphibia, ducktales, big city greens and the owl house are all my top currently airing shows on DisneySorry to hear about Amphibia. Really hope you get it soonUS account.Omg i didnt know there was a new ducktales. Thank you! Big city greens and owl house both seem to be divisive.Waiting for BH6 and Amphibia to come to uk thoughOk wait!Sorry, but there’s still a problem on disney+ with ducktales like every show. They fixed all but the first two episodes.Woo hoo is the real forst episode and escape to from atlantis is the actual second episode.After that, enjoy the rideAlso, you’re welcome and hope you enjoy 😁.As for owl house and big city greens? I can’t see anything divisive on them. Season two of greens is annoying because you can tell the executives forced unrealistic fantastical elements into the show and that takes away focus from the emotional elements that make the show so good.The owl house is quiet, relaxed and takes absolutely no cues from adventure time which excuse me for a moment:THANK GOD!!!!!!I’m sorry but this show is a breath of fresh air for not relying on shock humor and it makes me so happy.I hope you enjoy big hero 6 and Amphibia when they come to the UK. Theresplenty to keep you busy in the meantime 😊. I’m waiting for the weekenders myselfIs it as good as the og ducktales show?And thank you for the headsup!  May skip it then and just watch owl Ive seen BH6 S1 already ages ago but havent watched s2 yet. same with ravens home s3 yet. Amphibia though looks really good i cant wait to see itDucktales 2017 isn’t just as good as the original, it’s so much better it blows it out of the stratosphere! I don’t normally set up expectations for a show but I make an exception for this one because of what is coming. I can’t spoil it but once you’re done with season 2 just remember to look up the poster for season 3. Simply searching ducktales season 3 poster on duckduckgo or whatever search engine you use will tell you exactly what you’re in for.No need to skip. It’s just those two episodes that you need to watch first and then the first two listed “daytrip of doom” and “the great dime chase” are the real episodes 3 and 4. Those are the only mixed up ones unless they screwed up your launch which I really hope they didn’t haha.Amphibia is fantastic and I can’t wait for season 2!Wow..thats incredible you have me hyped up for this show now! And okay will do :) Youre a ton of help i appreciate itI meant skip the series big green. And do owl seriesNo prob dude. And it’s cool if you wanna skip big city greens. It’s not for everyone but I do greatly enjoy it even though the execs clearly messed with the second season. Have fun with the owl house when it comes to Disney+ eventually 😊It just doesnt seem as good? I guess. Ill do ducktales, the owl house, tangled series, amphibia, Bh6 S2 and Ravens home S3 all when it comes out lol sad times. S1 of tangled and ducktales 2017 out of those^ are only out atm. Everything else ive literally seen. Might skip bluey? Is it like as good as amphibia? And ill skip big city greens. Clone wars is waiting tooFor unknown reasons Disney has not made TaleSpin available in Europe.Just wanted to ask exactly the same question :(No. You guys just don\\'t have the dubs available. UnfortunatelyAlright thanks.In [ ]:I hate that you can’t change the audio output in their own UI.Probably a blessing and curse it’s releasing tomorrow after that lockdown announcement. It’s going to get hammered from day 1. I’m expecting service issues for most of the day!I\\'ve seen 1am.The timer on the official website reads to 1amEdit: I can\\'t countXbox Store has no app for it either as of nowJust gone live in my browser - no apps yet though??It\\'s working now[Proof ](https://i.imgur.com/Qxh55Sm.jpg)12am not 1amIs there anywhere I can get an app for this at all?Or will they not be available till release?I\\'m surprised there is no preorder the appIf the launch goes anything like in the US expect a rocky day struggling to log on etc etcIt\\'s available on GPlay StoreI\\'ve got it on my phone already but not on the firestickIt\\'s available on the play store for the android devicesUp now.What difference would an hour make?So far so good, I’ve had no issues.Someone in Disney doesn’t understand daylight saving time in Europe is not the same as the US...#whynotmidnightSame. I’ll download the app and maybe download some movies and stay off the network. If all else fails netflix is still working and we have prime as well12amno its 1 amNo it doesn’t. It reads 1AM.Yeah same on PS4, was wondering how this works.the countdown on the website says 5 and half hours leftThe app will be available at launch.Been wondering the same thingCame here searching for the answer to the same questionThis [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.disney.disneyplus&hl=en\\\\_GB](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.disney.disneyplus&hl=en_GB) just says it isn\\'t available for my devicesIf you have account in non-UK app stores, and Plus has already released there, you can download the app, had mine for a few weeks.You can log in but get a nit available in your country yet message which I guess will change once they switch everything on.I can’t find the app on the App Store. I’ve got an LG TV will check and report back.It\\'s gonna be worse in the UK. #LockdownWhy midnight?Website shows a countdown that ends at 1AMOooohhhhhhhCan I ask your source for this info?  Not doubting you, I’ve just been searching for that question for ages and can’t find it. The app was available for my PS4, but literally nowhere else I’ve looked.Same. Really frustrating. Only place I’ve found it so far is for my PS4.Hopefully they have taken into account the extra demandBecause that’s the start of the day?My source is my own experience in the U.S. when it launched in November.Give it a day or two they\\'re showing up for me (Ireland servers)i can see the x-men series from the 90ies[removed]The Disney+ Spanish Twitter account just said that these shows are \"coming soon\"🤞🏼Here\\'s the tweet: https://twitter.com/disneypluses/status/1243958477187362816?s=21**Please read this entire message**---> Your comment on r/DisneyPlus was removed due to a Rule 2 violation: \"No posts about piracy or VPNs.\" ---**If you believe this post was removed by mistake, please [contact the Moderators.](https://reddit.com/message/compose/?to=r/disneyplus&subject=Question%20About%20A%20Removal)****Violations may result in a temporary or permanent ban.**Did you pay for it yourself or use your own account?It\\'ll lock you out since you\\'re under 18.I used my own bank card, it’s registered as a child account so will it know then?What I mean is; when logging in and creating an account to use D+ did you use your own? Your birthday (I assume) you set to your own age and it states in the T&C\\'s you must be over 18. It mistakenly happens to someone who set their birthday incorrectly (according to Disney) and he had to make a whole different accountThe same login for Disney.co.uk and all their sitesIt didn’t ask me for my DOB, I might be being stupid here. I went on the website, signed up. Asked for email, a password and then my details but no birthday. It went through fine and was then able to log in on mobile and my PS4I guess it\\'s because you never used a Disney account before! Well have fun and be cautious- if they somehow find out that you\\'re under 18 you\\'ll be locked out xxOk thanks, if they do can I just arrange to put the money into my mums bank and pay through there? My parents have said they don’t wanna pay for it as were subscribed to so much already.Your mum would have to create anew account then you can give her the moneyYes of course.Every App on iOS has an URL SchemeGuess you need it for shortcuts right?Its disneyplus://Playstation 4 Pro and Xbox One X (both 4K supported console) support free Disney+ app if you want to stream in 4K to your UHD TV, while you can also game too if you\\'re an avid gamer.I also have similar 4K/UHD Samsung smartTV like you from around 2015, but my current use of Playstation 4 Pro, iPad Pro (9.7\") & iPhone 11 Pro Max or PC is my go to with Disney+ streaming.I think that your tv has Chromecast built inIf we didnt have ps4 we wouldn\\'t have been able to make use of the service. Our tv is similar age but I thought it would be new enough. Typical!You could buy a relatively cheap blue ray player with apps?No.  You need a streaming device (roku, fire stick, etc) or you need to watch on your computer or phone.  If you can hook your computer to the TV, what is so difficult about using your mouse?I unfortunately don\\'t own a PS4 or Xbox. I have a PS3 tho. But 1. It doesn\\'t support 4k and 2. It probably doesn\\'t even support Disney Plus on the store.Howbdo I check?Because it really is an old device and often stutters, when I\\'m trying to watch things on 1080p or 4k. And when I had Netflix on my TV, it was very comfortable to just use the remote to type stuff and not get up, use the keyboard (or display keyboard) and type things on there. Guess I\\'ll have to use that method tho. Thanks for your response :)Well, while your tv is turned on and connEven Stevens absolutely is on the service. They have the series and the movie. I know because I\\'m literally watching it right nowI am from the ukI can’t find itAlso is there not fox shows on it Also is there going to be abc shows (I read somewhere)They gotta keep some stuff to keep subscribtions alive. There\\'s a ton of Disney channel content not preset (Filmore, Proud Family, Pepper Ann just off the top of my head) my best guess is that they will added at some point in the future.ected to the internet, open YouTube and see if the Chromecast icon appears. Press it and look if your tv is therwWell... I have it, but I\\'m unsure if that means if I have Chromecast installed or my TV is just connecting with my phone because its a SmartTVYou\\'ll be fine. If you are still concerned try Spotify or apple music or Google play movies or TuneInThis is how it was meant to be, out of chronological order, just like the movies. Meant to simulate the feeling of old school film serials.There is a list online that puts the episodes in chronological order if you would like, but its not necessary to enjoy the show since it was designed to be watched out of order.ThanksIt seems that Disney+ changed this. Where there used to be a limit to 10 devices, it now just asks you to relogin to a previous device if there is an 11th device that was logged into. So there are 10 devices that can logged into at once, but there is no limit on the amount of devices that you can log in to. This was discussed in another post by another redditor.Oh, thank you very much!Having the same issueGot it now, was Xbox issuesSince all the Pixar shorts that appeared before films made their way to Disney+, I expect the Simpson\\'s one to also. I would not be surprised it it appeared on there at the same time as Onward.I was saddened that the short was not released alongside the digital release.It ran with a simpsons short? Somehow that seems so strange to me. Did anyone see it? How did that play with the audience?I hope they add the first Maggie short \"The Longest Daycare\" to Disney+ as well. It originally aired before Ice Age: Continental Drift in theaters in 2012.I feel like it’s gonna be uploaded to their YouTube channel like what happened when The Longest Daycare got an Oscar nomination.That and all 30 complete seasons of Simpsons plus The Simpsons Movie are available on Disney+, they’d be crazy not to put that Maggie Simpson short on Disney+.Maybe until the blu ray/DVD release it’ll become a Disney+ exclusive.It was really funny and my audience ate it up. Kids didn\\'t understand much of it though.I think they nailed it. Simpsons without a single word spoken and some of the best Simpsons in a long timeI thought it was so out of place. We saw it on a disney cruise and it just didn\\'t seem to fit with the audience. I don\\'t think any of the kids understood it and I immediately thought: \"Ugh a Simpsons short in front of a Disney movie? What are they thinking???\"Wouldn’t even surprise me if that happenedDo they have the original Maggie Simpson short that played before Ice Age 4? It’s on the Simpsons YouTube channel if it’s not, but that’d be nice to haveHave they fixed the aspect ratio issue? Getting ready to binge them when it launches here later!That’s EXACTLY what I thought. I get that Disney bought fox but I would never let my younger children watch the simpsons and I just don’t find that appropriate before a Pixar film.They’re still the upscaled 16x9 cropped prints that Fox did long before the Disney-Fox deal.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiF\\\\_Ux2X58U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiF_Ux2X58U)Even Stevens absolutely is on the service. They have the series and the movie. I know because I\\'m literally watching it right nowI am from the ukI can’t find itAlso is there not fox shows on it Also is there going to be abc shows (I read somewhere)They gotta keep some stuff to keep subscribtions alive. There\\'s a ton of Disney channel content not preset (Filmore, Proud Family, Pepper Ann just off the top of my heabest guess is that they will added at some point in the futureYeah for anyone who hasn\\'t seen it already there are huge spoilers in this article, don\\'t read it.Well I am personally glad that Disney have done it this way. We will be supporting this platform for the longterm and having free trial folks  signing up, killing the resources to binge all the stuff they want in one week only hams the service. If you want to watch a series released weekly then support the industry and sign up.It\\'s also not accurate. The article says: \"Upon release in the US, the series was released in episodic instalments after the initial release of episodes 1 and 2.\"Whereas on day one in the US there was only episode one, until the first Friday after the mid-week launch when episode two dropped.Disney should of released the entire series regardless of where a pandemic was happening or not. Because of COVID-19, I personally think they really should release the entire series for the UK to ensure them to stay home. If COVID-19 weren’t happening, Disney still should of released the entire series. The fact that this series already aired says a lot. I mean, I understand that with new shows that air the first time Disney would wanna release them weekly that’s cool. But for a series that already aired, that’s not cool and Disney should just release it for everyone. I mean UK residents can just go on illegal movie websites and watch the entire series instead of waiting every Friday. If Disney wants to avoid that, then release the whole damn series on Disney+ already for other countries!!!!!Initial release includes that first week.> I personally think they really should release the entire series for the UK to ensure them to stay homeFor the entire 10 hours it lasts?I would like Fox’s Peter Pan and the Pirates for my kids to added considering it’s it up to view anywhereWould love to see X-Files on there.Same with the Isle of Man.Yes all regions have different content due to rights issues. Would be impossible to go through all the differences succinctly but generally I think the US has more older tv shows with the UK getting a slightly better movie lineup (due to existing agreements in the US)One thing that I think is missing is Bonkers. I\\'m sure the US has it.It\\'s a bit strange that it doesn\\'t have the full seasons of some programs like Dark wing Duck.If course as Disney gets more rights back the content should be a bit more uniform across regions.> all regions have different content due to rights issuesAcross *all* services, not just Disney+. Best way to see what is available where is justwatch.comNot just due to rights issues. The European versions of Disney+ are missing some content that was made available in the US. However, most of this content is NOT under contract somewhere else (the 1955 Mickey Mouse Club for example), so there has to be another reason.Gradual rollout. It\\'s not on Samsung or Roku either. Best to just wait until morning.It was saying that for me too and I closed the store waited a few mins and now it’s saying I can download itIt\\'s definitely on there. I actually downloaded it back in November, on the marketplace website. Probably might take a little longer to show up.Did you manage to download it?  I get a something went wrong errorNo I couldn’t and I’ve tried it a few times,I tried downloading a trial for a game aswell and that didn’t work so it could just be the store, I was able to download it on my phone and PS4 with no problems.Just checked Xbox live status page there, and they are having issues with purchasing items from the store.  Worldwide affected apparently.  They are working to fix itDownloaded and installed the app fine have you tried force closing the App Store?I had to force close and re open the App Store on iPhone before it worked, still waiting for it to show on Xbox thoughNo it’s out on it for meHas anyone else gotten a \"Please contact customer service\" message?ive only managed to get it on android sofar, still not on my samsung tvIt\\'s active on the play store & xbox so far for meNo firestick yetAnyone found the 4K contentXbox for me says currently unavailableThey should refund itA lot of places do it to check the card is active and then they refund it.It\\'s a preauthorization charge to make sure you have legit payment, but it will be refunded.Ok thanksI was thinking of that, as its a similar system that paypal has when they charge your bill but theres a code on it to activateThey charged me $1, and refunded it almost a month later. I also paid with PayPal.Maybe try calling customer service....All uk servers go live in 40 mins.It hasn\\'t launched yetAre you under the legal age of majority in your country?What country are you in? Is this an app or a web browser?I\\'m in the US and mine isnt logging in.I\\'ve tried calling support but they hang up as soon as I get through, I dont know if its because it\\'s too late here or not but its stressfulIn the uk (England) and it\\'s on the appI think it’s because they’re really busy and short of staff due to the Coronavirus. I’ve got the same problem.I thought that but it turns out it was because I was \"a minor\" even though my parents set it up and paid for it... i think they just wanted the extra £10 from meI\\'m in Ireland and it\\'s been up and running since midnight 👍Thanks ive figured out how to get itIt’s the HDR. If you have the ability to turn HDR off but keep 4K on like I can on my Apple TV it makes it WAY better.It’s only happening with Frozen 2 nothing else on D+I notice it with everything HDR. Mandalorian was way too dark at times.I played 3 or 4 different shows and they are fine, just F2 is dark. Switched profiles and on every profile it’s dark.You can do it monthlyI watched Winter Soldier and Ant-Man recently (about a month ago) and this did not happen.I\\'m using a TCL Roku TV on hard-wired connection and I\\'m in California.its already livehttps://preview.disneyplus.com/uk?cid=dss-disneyplus-email-DSS-DisneyPlus-Email-Brand-PRSP-20200317_SVNDYS_EN-GB-NA-SPT-Sign_Up-20200316_UK_PRPS-2020_3_17-sfmc-1101--Button_OrderIt\\'s notI\\'ve just looked at starting the 7 day free and signing up using pay pal and Disney wants me to pay a pound now. What\\'s up with that?I’m not sure but it said the same for me, haven’t checked my PayPal to see if they’ve actually charged meYeah its strange! Nvm cheers though.Currently not. The sign in works with a key that is generated per device which is not revoked when the main password is changed.ThxThe Mandalorian is on weekly release for the UK just like it was for the US.I did read about some fox shows like Malcom in the middle being on it (I have on dvd anyway)And I did read that abc shows would be on itThe kids show Bluey isn\\'t on the UK oneI was also hoping to see X-Men Evolution, but that doesn\\'t seen to be included either.[deleted]Same in Germany, but honestly, I don’t get it... same with clone wars season 7.Friday, then every episode after will be released each Friday.My guess would be every TuesdayThis is for the UK app btwTry disconnecting and reconnecting it from TV settings under your profile icon in the Watch Now tab, and then under connected apps.Happens on my Apple TV.Tried that, when i go into settings on the tv app, disney plus isnt an option to connetc to the appProbably since they get the episodes after Disney XD broadcast but I know XD has done Season 3 and 4 so I\\'m gonna give it a while (3 months) to get them.If it\\'s not available in the hub, then your TV is probably too old. In that case, as a last ditch effort you could try updating the firmware (system software)Give it time they\\'re slowly activating it on various platformsThat\\'s just sad if Netflix works but Disney doesn\\'t lolIs there any way to know how old the TV might be? I\\'m rlly bad at technology hahahAh alright, it just officially released in Spain like 20 minutes ago hahaThank you for the answer!There\\'s a model number somewhere on the back.https://www.samsung.com/us/appstore/app/G19280013786-compatibleThat page has a list of models that support the Disney+ appI can\\'t find it on mine... I gotta mention it was also bought second handWhy would you want a logo to stay on the screen permanently?No thanksJust reminds me of watching Disney Channel as a kid.Nobody can help with that. Contact Disney.**Remove** the app on your \"Apple Box\", then **restart** it (from the System menu). **Reinstall** the app and log in. That should work.Thanks but that didn\\'t work. Oh forgot to mention. I can\\'t even log into the app on my phone either. Its telling me to restart my subscription. This is very odd.Did you figure out your issue?Yes Disney screwed up. So they gave me free 30 days 👍I think so. They\\'re staggering the release of stuff that\\'s already aired (even completely) in the US. I\\'m currently trying to decide whether I should cancel over this.I can’t get onto it right now, but are you saying that there aren’t as many titles? Why? Seems like false advertisement because I thought we were going to get everything from how it’s advertised.There’s a LOT of content already.There is but even Stevens is missing I heard something about abc shows I heard that Hulu will be for adult content but it’s not available in the uk so how will that work and you have to pay extra for Espn and Hulu in USA I think When they are part of Disney and should be part of the dealYeah there is, I managed to get on the site and was pleasantly surprised.Depends. What country are you in?Does anyone know if this is the same for IOS? Can\\'t seem to get the app. Cheers.Hi, I\\'m in Italy with a LG LF590V (Webos 3.21) and i currently can\\'t find the app on the content store. I\\'ve just chatted with helpdesk and they said to wait a couple of days. Official documentation page says Webos 3.0+ is required.https://help.disneyplus.com/csp?id=csp_article_content&sys_kb_id=86d4df3bdb6f801cb1e6c28d13961998let\\'s hope :)UK.Restart AppStore.Not available until 1am. It\\'s in the LG content. Press the house shape menu button to get the row of icons and scroll through until you see it. Then once in the app use search.It’s not available.What makes you say 1am? I still can’t see it on iOS or LG 😔Edit. Got it on iOS now. Just waiting on LG. Thought the launch was at midnight (laptop streaming worked then)Edit 2. Now it’s on LG. All systems are goOh thanks so much.Browserfenster am laptop geht schon. apps sind noch nicht daIt\\'s at 1am in the UK if that helps. Maybe 1am in Germany?Bei mir läft die app nur bis 91%.. was ein witzBrowser geht bei mir nicht. Immer wenn ich auf einloggen klicke redirected es mich auf die main page. https://preview.disneyplus.com/atit was 11pm in the ukI couldn\\'t access it until 12am and had to go through the online play store to get the app. Still not available no firestick and the countdown said 1amEdit: It\\'s available on fire tv nowThe option will be available at launch.If you want to pre order you need to pay annually. remember that preorder is cheaperFor preorder, no, monthly is not an option. You can do that when the service opens up. Preorder is for annual subscriptions only.These masters were done by Fox for FX long before Disney acquired then.However, Disney has promised to fix this and are remastering the episodes properly. Should be out sometime this year.The 16:9 is brutal on the older episodes. I was really taken back by how much it impacts the image. Even the TV at the end of the opening credits is missing so much at the top and bottom. It\\'s great that we have The Simpsons on the service but hopefully this can be fixed soon as I just can\\'t watch the older episodes like this.Blame Fox. At some point they did HD transfers of The Simpsons, thinking \"Hey, everyone loves HD, right?!\", but they also thought \"Hey, everyone loves widescreen, right?!\" so their HD transfers were cropped to 16:9.    These are the versions that have been in syndication for years. If you\\'re a Simpsons fan surely you would have been aware of this. And so these are the versions Disney inherited from Fox.    And, yes, these are the versions that were on Disney+ when it launched in the US in November and, yes, people complained about it at the time, but Disney immediately said they were going to do new HD transfers in the correct aspect ratio and that they would be available early this year.    So personally I was hoping that they would be ready for the UK launch and so I\\'m disappointed that they\\'re not, but on the whole I\\'m glad that Disney are working on it, instead of a lot of studios that would just say \"Huh? What\\'s an aspect ratio?\", and in the meantime the 16:9 versions are better than nothing.They said they\\'d fix it early this year, they have 1 more month basically lolBut FX already did end up releasing non-cropped versions after a while. Are you sure Disney is doing anything else beyond whatever they did?Dude there\\'s literally no excuse for this.It\\'s not some mom and pop company\\'s first app.It\\'s Disney.  No excuse to knowingly release content broken in this way and ask for payment.I never said they didn’t.They were SD.They are doing an HD remaster of the original 4:3.They were only given HD remastered cropped into 16:9 and SD masters in 4:3. They don’t want to release it until they have remastered the 4:3 versions to HD. They are taking their time on this and doing it right.In case you didn’t know, there is a lot of episodes.At 1am!Thank youI\\'ve seen it stated you can download content onto (up to) 10 devices at once, and you can have up to 4 concurrent streams. I haven\\'t seen anywhere that states a limit on the number of devices registered to your account.You can only have 4 concurrent streams. The 10 device limit is how many can be logged in at the same time until you have to log in again.  The 10 device limit also includes how many devices can have downloaded content. You can actually use as many devices as you want. Each box (Roku, Chromecast, Firestick, PS4, smart tv, phone, tablet, etc.) counts as a device.  I don\\'t believe a web browser counts as a device.Been streaming all day on a Gen1 Firestick.Same for me, works on my Xbox but not fire stickOn my fire stick absolutely nothing works. I can get onto D+ and select things but whenever something starts playing it just sits on a grey screen. Really agitatingI had this problem, would not get as far as home screen on Disney Plus.I uninstalled Disney Plus, restarted Fire TV, reinstalled Disney Plus.Now it works fine.Unfortunately this also did not work for meNow live in the browser and they’re listed as individual seasonsUnfortunately, the episode order is messed up too.Other routers may cause similar issues with other or no error messages.Yes exactly, or even OpenDNS etc. if you happen to use content filtering.  It seems DisneyPlus was just added to a bunch of them.I think you are german, so only paypal and credit card on the official site.Thank youAlmost all of the classic Disney and Pixar stuff as well as the new content of said studios is on the streaming service so don\\'t worry.There’s plenty of stuff to keep everyone entertainedThere are mounds of content on Disney Plus, including Frozen II, Moana, and tons of Classic Disney and Pixar films. Your kids will love it. There is also content for the adults too. The Disney Plus originals are really great, and if you are a Star Wars fan, you can look forward to the Mandalorian. 10/10, Disney Plus is by far the best streaming service ever! (However, launch tomorrow will probably be crowded, so servers might be down for a while, or the content might be glitchy. After the first day, everything usually resolves!)Idk about the UK but the US has all the classic disney and Pixar films plus much more.Can\\'t confirm UK specifics but there should be plenty for kids of all ages, and fun adults too!Full list of all UK launch content can be found here.https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/disney-plus-uks-huge-launch-line-up-revealed-from-star-wars-to-the-mcuThey have a lot of old stuff but def. not all of it.  It\\'s actually amazing how much they do have on their from their vaults.why would you even waste our time with this absurd questionGreat stuff - cheers. Just need get the the app now as my sony bravia only shows the Disney Life app for some reason. Don\\'t want to have to cast it from my phone!Because I saw a list of content that didn\\'t seem to include any classics or modern pixar films and was focusing on Star wars and marvel films which would not be suitable for my 1 and 3 year olds. I was concerned I\\'d misunderstood the point of the service and had already pre ordered. Thanks!App launches at 1AM tomorrow (24th)Great news!No problemYou\\'ll need to include what country you\\'re in.Shows up for me in USIt doesn’t show up on your profile if the kid settings are on. If you turn them off, you’ll find it within seconds.I updated the prefix to usHmm I just switched accounts and realized it\\'s not available for a child account.I don\\'t use the kid settings because I don\\'t have kids but... this is weird to me. I wonder why Moana would be restricted by kid settings.I don’t really know. When Netflix had Moana, it always showed up in the kids section.Disney+ currently filters everything rated above G out of the Kids profiles. Moana is rated PG. It\\'s ludicrous to me as to why, but that is what I have observed. For example, Finding Nemo is rated G and is available to my kids but Finding Dory is rated PG and is not available.That’s not entirely true. Frozen and Frozen 2 are PG rated and both movies are real easy to find with the kid settings.Well then it makes even less sense.I am in Ireland and launches here tomorrow...My LG TV is about 3 or 4 years old and has the Disney+ app so i would assume it\\'s available on newer models.Yes, I’m on ab LG C9 OLED with webOS and it has a Disney+ app.It\\'s not in the LG content store yet.. but then it\\'s not in the Google play store yet either hereYes every single LG TV with webOS running lad.It’ll be there at 1AM. Just give it another 40 minutes.America sucks there’s hardly any Fox properties...Canada as wellDum Dum give me gum gumI wish we had this in the USIs the 1st and 3rd there? ExcitedIt\\'s really what you prefer, but Netherlands version could do better as well. We\\'re missing a lot of old shows (like Talespin) that the US has and we also only have like 10 old Disney shorts.Nope, just the second one for some reason.Could take time as fantastic four only had rise of the silver surferFirst of all the £50 deal ends in 59 mins at 23:59. The app launches at 1 am. It’s honestly pretty simple decision. Do you like Disney,marvel and Star Wars shows? If so get it! Also 31 seasons of Simpson’s is on it.Some of the new series may be delayed because of this pandemic. I\\'m at least hoping they add some more Fox content gradually.I’ve been considering the £50 deal for weeks now but finally caved before it ended! Already in and there is soooo much content. Perfect for these next couple of weeks at home :)Quickly pre order it. It’s definitely worth it they’ll be films you haven’t heard of getting released in the next couple of months that people are gonna be talking about not to mention shows like Winter soldier start in august.30 innit?I\\'ve just preordered!! I\\'m a massive Marvel & star wars fan, I also love the Simpsons. I\\'m just concerned that the content this year will be a bit slow.DONE!! I guess I can just try it for a year, I love marvel & star wars if it\\'s bad - I just won\\'t renew.Yes sorryDoes it matter? There\\'s so much good stuff on it from launch it\\'ll take a year to get throughI just wanted to make sure I’m not going mental and missed something lolI am a US user and so far I think the quality of the app is fine, and streaming works well. I only have issues on my apple tv. Sometimes I can hear the audio but there is no picture. I don\\'t check it enough to know all the new content, I usually find out about new things because of this subreddit. But it seems to be pretty consistent that they are adding stuff monthly like most other services. I got D+ because of the launch discount and just to be able to watch Mandalorian the day it came out was worth it. I grew up watching Disney films and knowing that if I want to watch one, especially now, I can. I do wish they had more content that was not just family-friendly, but I am holding out hope they will figure that part out now that the FOX acquisition is complete.With regards to streaming quality, it might be worth noting that Disney+, alongside Netflix, Prime, etc. have reduced their streaming quality to combat broadband strains due to the increase of people at home. I think Disney have vowed to reduce by at least 25%. I can’t wait for the UK release on Tuesday, but I must confess it’s dampened my enthusiasm slightly, despite understanding the reasoning. The 4K content is one of the big wins of the service for me and I’ve noticed that Disney have quietly stopped mentioning it in recent days. Of course it won’t disappear, but for the time being it’s a missing feature.Is there a look at the library for UK and Ireland anywhere? I\\'ve searched the web but can\\'t find a thing. Just want to know will every MCU movie (except SM&Hulk) and SW movie be on it?Quality of the app is good, at least I like it. There were definitely some hiccups, bugs and missing features at launch, but they got ironed out in the first few weeks.Quality of streaming is top-notch, if you have the bandwidth. I’ve been blown away by the picture quality of their 4K HDR Dolby Vision content, which looks just as good as a 4K Blu-ray to my eyes. Dolby Atmos audio quality has also been great. Not as good as a disc, but most people probably won’t notice any difference. All of that being said I’ve heard that many streaming services are going to be reducing their bandwidth in the European area, so that would definitely affect quality.A good amount of content is being added on a regular basis, *if* you enjoy catalog titles. There’s heaps of great content on Disney+ in my opinion, especially because I love a lot of the old classics (especially the animated shorts from the 30s, 40s, 50s) that I haven’t been able to find previously. That said, I have heard a lot of complaints from people who only like to watch new stuff that’s never been seen before. There is some great content in that category as well, but it’s not nearly as abundant. But if you’re a Marvel or Star Wars fan and you don’t already own everything, having access to the majority of the MCU and all of the Star Wars films in 4K Dolby Vision with Dolby Atmos is incredible. If you’re a fan of classic Disney films, you’ll be in heaven.Promotion-wise, I haven’t seen any promotions offered here (Canada), other than the annual subscription discount. It’s already a pretty good price, I don’t see Disney needing to do any big promotions other than maybe a pre-order launch special.Some of the new original (and thus exclusive) content I’ve loved watching:* *The Mandalorian:* no surprise, it’s the big draw* *The Imagineering Story:* if you’re a Disney fan, or just a fan of artistic design and engineering in general, this multi-episode documentary about the making of Disney theme parks is fantastic.* *The World According to Jeff Goldblum:* he’s a quirky guy and might be an acquired taste, but the several episodes I’ve seen I’ve found to be quite entertaining.* *Noelle:* I thought it was going to be cheesy, and it is, but it also manages to also be a warm, feel-good Christmas film with genuine heart.I’ve found Disney+ absolutely worth the price of my annual subscription. If you’re unsure or hesitant, just sign up for a month, check out the content, and if it really looks like it’s not for you, cancel within 7 days and you won’t be charged. (At least I assume they’ll have the 7-day trial in other countries?)The biggest issue, is that the UK and the EU get shafted from a lot of shows. If you happen to like Talespin, Bonkers, Emperor\\'s New School or Hercules, you\\'re screwed.The qualitiy is good if you aan me and most things are family friendly but it also has shows like agents of shield and about offers Disney gives are in the netherlands like: bij this tv and jou get 2 years of Disney+ free1. Decent apps overall, with some very minor qualms that I have with the Fire TV version (and presumably other TV UIs as well). Thing to keep in mind in case you have data caps - it doesn\\'t allow you to restrict quality at the moment.2. Completely dependent on contracts they may have with other distributors in your region. My understanding is anything they have the rights to is already there. I haven\\'t used it all *that* much so far, but I hear that some shows (e.g. Phineas & Ferb) have episodes in the wrong order. :/1. It’s not too bad considering it’s fairly new. Trying to rewind like 30 seconds can be pretty laggy sometimes but it’s not too bad. The app is annoying sometimes on one of my tv’s but perfect on the other. The mobile app is fine2. They haven’t released many fox things as of now, but release things when they say they will or sometimes sooner like frozen 23. I haven’t seen the price change since launchIt\\'s pretty awesome, IMO if you like Disney or Marvel stuff. There\\'s pretty much every Disney movie ever. Movies it\\'s strong on.Most of the Marvel stuff except Agents of Shield and stuff still contracted to Netflix is on there (Black Panther just came back to Dis+). Less Fox stuff.I love the marvel stuff and cartoons (they just added an avengers anime I\\'m watching, and I was watching Hulk and the Agents of Smash previously, and there\\'s Gargoyles), and there are a ton of those and you get one new movie a month you\\'d probably rent anyway if you like Disney/Marvel stuff (this month is Frozen II/Lion King (live action), last month was Toy Story 4 and month before was Aladdin (live action) the first month I watched Captain Marvel and Avengers: Endgame), so at $6 or $7 it\\'s fine. Honestly they would have gotten me for that at the redbox.It also has like every family movie from the 90s and 00s and most MCU stuff.It\\'s significantly weaker on TV (excluding that animation I mentioned) than netflix, unless you like old Disney channel shows. Personally, I have no idea what any of them are, I never really liked the Disney channel, but I\\'m told they have a decent selection.Also, The Mandalorian is the best tv show I\\'ve seen in the last 10 years. I like the Jeff Goldblum one a lot too, but it\\'s basically just a more conventional travel show.Banwagoning with a couple of q\\'s!I can\\'t seem to find a specifiic android app on the store for Plus. Is it just going to appear att midnight? Also, does anyone know if I\\'ll be able to watch on  BT Youview box?The resolution is great. Disney bought BAMtech to launch this service, they streamed HBO Now if you’re looking for a comparison. Here’s a list for 4K UHD titles at launch: https://www.finder.com/uk/list-disney-plus-4k-uhd-moviesThe content is vast but new content is a little light. I’m not sure if they’ll release The Mandalorian all at once or episodically like in the U.S. but they’ve proven to be flexible (ex: dropping Frozen 2 early due to the Coronavirus). New series look great but they’re expecting delays for the same reason.It’s definitely worth it to sign up for the one-year promotional offer. It’s almost half the cost of Netflix and a year is more than enough time to decide if you want to keep it or not.Edit: Nat Geo is definitely a bonus and they’ll probably bundle it with Hulu and ESPN + like they did in the States.I\\'m a UK user and I\\'ve pre-ordered but I can\\'t find the app on my SMART TV or on the Play Store on my mobile. Is that because it\\'s not launched yet or because my devices are incompatible?Thanks. I\\'m pretty sold on the original content, but the delays could push much of it beyond the first year, so now I\\'m having to consider the existing content to see if it\\'s still jumping aboard from the start.Does usa have any fox content as other countries have fox films does usa an Canada have them?Good shout. To be honest, I have a 4k TV and 4K Netflix and Prime to go with it, but I probably can\\'t tell the difference anyway... Maybe the TV isn\\'t big enough to make it significant.I think that was mainland Europe not us in the uk, my Netflix is still streaming 4K hdr no problem, same with 4K YouTube videos business as usual thankfully.I saw a complete list of everything that will be available at launch, but can\\'t remember where. It might have been on IGNJustwatch is good, you can also use it to compare content between countries. But they don\\'t have D+ yet for UK. Hopefully it\\'s added right after release.    [https://www.justwatch.com/uk](https://www.justwatch.com/uk)Full library: https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/full-disney-plus-content-list-uk-4004451https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a31248528/disney-plus-content-list/The list is split up in a weird way but here\\'s everythingThanks for that in-depth response. Lots of useful info here.I would normally go for the trial and cancel if I don\\'t like it as you\\'ve suggested. My reason for making this post is that they have a pre-order offer of £50 instead of £60 for the year, so I\\'m making the call on whether I want to dive in on the whole year sub, as that option only has a day left before it expires, I believe. I think I\\'m gonna go for it anyway. There\\'s plenty on there and it\\'s not a huge amount to pay for a whole year.Eh, US users also got screwed out of shows that should be there. I think they\\'re holding stuff back to release slowly over time.Thanks. Yeah, free periods with purchases such as TVs are quite commonplace, but not really offers that are available to normal users. Sounds like they don\\'t yet offer discounted subscription as an incentive other than the pre-order.I\\'ll probably have to use the Fire Stick app, so can I ask what issues you had? Or was it just the lack of quality options?Go for it.My understanding is the app will become available tomorrow when the service goes live. I don\\'t know anything about the BT box, though I don\\'t think I\\'ve seen it mentioned.The Mandalorian will be weekly here, which is an odd decision. I guess it\\'s just in keeping with how they plan to launch their original shows in general.No Hulu or ESPN here (or HBO Now for that matter) so no bundles likely. But thanks for the info. I wasn\\'t aware they would have any 4K at all - even though they probably won\\'t have for a while here since they are restricting quality of streams due to expected high demands during quarantine.Hulu and ESPN+ aren\\'t a thing here.From what I\\'ve read, the app won\\'t become available until the service goes live.Oooh yeah, that is a tempting offer for sure. I think a lot of it comes down to your tastes in movies. Like I said, if you like Classic Disney, there’s a massive library of that. If you’re more a superhero/blockbuster fan, there’s a bit of that, but nothing you haven’t seen before other than The Mandalorian. If you’re a Pixar fan, almost everything Pixar is here, including the shorts. If you like documentaries and nature stuff, there seems to be quite a bit of that too, although I haven’t explored much of it myself other than The Imagineering Story. If you want R-rated mature content, there’s none of that. Just because Disney owns Fox content, don’t expect Die Hard to ever be added to Disney+. They seem to want to keep it very family friendly.Then why do they only add Movies and originals on Disney+ when they update? There\\'s supposed to be content weekly, but there\\'s nothing but the Proud Family added after launch in the US. Also, since Corona Virus means new Movies and shows will be on hiatus, this is the time they should add more older shows.But it is pretty cheap especially if u share it with 4 people bc u can stream on 4 devices at the same timeIt\\'s missing some *very* nitpicky quality of life corner case UX behavior that\\'s present in different combinations in both the Netflix app and the Amazon player used for Prime Video. Excerpt from my 4-star Amazon review of the app from soon after launch (present time **commentary in bold**):>But as expected with any new service, it has some way to go before I\\'d consider it a 5-star worthy perfect client. Here are a few requests that come to mind if Disney is reading:  >  >1. Let me use the left/right nav buttons to skip forward and backward by 10 seconds. It\\'s currently too many button presses as I have to use the controls on the playback bar. **You have to press a nav button to show the player bar, select the +10 or -10 buttons next to the play/pause button and press them.**  2. PLEASE give me control over the appearance of subtitles. I keep English subs on for everything just for convenience, but English is my first language and my eyesight is fine, so I prefer to keep the subtitles small. This Disney+ app defaults to very large subs that I often see on discs, which is super distracting. I like how Amazon\\'s native Prime Video player on Fire TV gives me fine control over this.  3. It\\'s not possible to hide the playback controls when the content is paused. Other services let me do this by pressing back. Disney+ does hide the controls this way when content is playing, but not when it\\'s paused. It\\'s not a big deal, but I like to have it for some reason. **Same as \"down\" on the Netflix app and \"back\" in the Amazon player. This** ***may*** **have changed but can\\'t remember for sure.**  4. Make the service Alexa-enabled so I can say \"resume The Mandalorian on Disney+\" etc. But then I can\\'t even get Alexa to \"open Disney+\" so maybe someone at Amazon needs to fix that first. **I** ***can*** **now say \"open Disney+\".**  5. Add a resume watching control somewhere in the app. Though, I hear this used to be a thing before US launch, and it\\'s likely only been temporarily removed. **This came a couple weeks after launch.**  6. Someone on Reddit asked for controls to lower the streaming quality for folks with data caps. I am not affected by this, but sure, this would be nice to have, especially considering the amount of stuff that\\'s available in 4K HDR.   >  >Some of these are nitpicks, but #1 and #2 are very important to me. Not enough to keep me from using the service, but definitely sore thumbs on what is otherwise a decent looking streaming service at a great price.TaThat\\'s reassuring, thank you. One of the articles I read said I could sign up using the app which made me wonder.Ah, that\\'s good to know. Thank you.Perhaps once it launches, I\\'d expect that to be an option.Goes live at 1am i believe !Disney Plus isn\\'t available yet. Try tomorrow.I know but it shouldn\\'t prevent me from login in on one piece of tech but not the other.Check your ad blocker. You need to disable it on the Disney Plus website.[removed]**Please read this entire message**---> Your comment on r/DisneyPlus was removed due to a Rule 2 violation: \"No posts about piracy or VPNs.\" ---**If you believe this post was removed by mistake, please [contact the Moderators.](https://reddit.com/message/compose/?to=r/disneyplus&subject=Question%20About%20A%20Removal)****Violations may result in a temporary or permanent ban.**what a tragedyThey\\'ll probably be back.>I would find out that The Simpson’s ratio was wrong to where all the visual gags are gone*Some*, definitely not *all*. This may be the most overblown criticism I\\'ve seen of D+.  As for content, the selling point of the service is the catalog. Star Wars, Toy Story, Frozen, Iron Man, Avengers, Aladdin, Lion King, etc.  The cumulative total of these Blu rays would cost you hundreds of dollars. To get access to them for $7 a month, that\\'s a steal. That\\'s why Disney isn\\'t pumping out originals left and right.I\\'ve been watching legend of the three caballeros, loving it. I think there is a good amount of content and its only going to increase from here.Watch season 1 & 2 of Gargoyles>\\tThen, I would find out that Disney+ has a ton of bugs such as shows/movies disappearing, constantly crashing, the audio not being synced in, shows having episodes out of order, etc... I would soon find out that the interface isn’t exactly the best for Disney+ and could definitely be better such as a continue button for the next episode, [...]Could you be more specific on your technical experience? Some devices have software that isn\\'t fully compatible with the Disney Plus output. Sharing details may help others to find what suits them best.My experience with an AppleTV is good. There have been some glitches, related to my (wired) internet connection. Also, the interface does feel like it\\'s just six months old, but content compensates more than enough. There is enough to discover still - not all my kind of entertainment, but it\\'s mostly worth trying.It’s got everything (hyperbole) you’d want from a DISNEY subscription service IMO. Sure there’s some things missing but it’s hardly underwhelming for £5.99 (or £4.17 a month; that’s the price of two rented films max).Totally agree content is blehSame. I’m kinda like forcing myself to open the app and browse. And get bored not finding anything I want to watch.I agree tbh. I love that we have the service, don’t get me wrong, but Disney is known for its meticulous, precise attention to detail. There’s nothing meticulous or precise about the service, it feels like it should have/could have been pushed back to give it some much-needed TLC. It’s so bare-bones right now in terms of functionality and the content slate has been a little disappointing. They’re making a lot of little mistakes (messing up the aspect ratio for The Simpsons, leaving out episodes or whole seasons of *old*, finished shows like Recess etc). Sometimes I feel like I’m using a beta version, not the widely-released, fully-functional service. That said, I will continue to pay for it because, in the immortal words of Forky: “I’M TRASH!”I just ordered it for my girlfriend, i browsed through it, 2-3 movies are ok but the rest is....Original content is coming, some people just don\\'t have patience I guess.Cmon now, the service has over 50 oscar award winning films on it.App is gonna be released exactly at 1am when the timer for germany runs out. App is already on Apples and Googles Servers ready to get released which probably will be a timed release ( developers can enable that option in apple connect ) together with the launch. Otherwise it makes no sense.Was wondering the same thing. I assume the most logical time would be 2 am since that is when the service is launching.I believe it releases about 11pm- 1am depending on the time zone and I am suprised they didn’t release the app out so that everyone could download (but servers would remain down)it over the space of a week rather than everyone download it at once and be stressful on the broad bandIt’s actually 2AM in Germany then.Where exactly is that timer you speak of?Ooops. Miscalculation :)On their website.There’s a count down timer on the official page anyway and it’s in line with the time zone you’re in. OP should be fine.Yea, nvm thanks, I found it :PWhat country are you in? I’m in the US, and both of those movies are on Disney+ for me.You might have to search for them.For me each did come up under “suggestions” for the earlier films.They must have been removed because I remember watching Pocahontas II about a month agoOdd ones to remove... can\\'t imagine anywhere else have a contract for them that didn\\'t include the first ones as well.Are you searching from a kids profile? Cause there are some odds filters when you do.Edit: Nevermind. Mulan 2 pulls up just fine under a US kids profile.I’m in Canada and only Pocahontas & Mulan are on Disney+, their sequels aren’t on yet if they ever will show up on Canadian Disney+.They’re probably still on Disney+ where you live, I’m in Canada and I don’t recall ever seeing these sequels available in Canada.I’m in Canada and we have most Disney movies,and some Fox movies. Yet we don’t have these 2 sequels available on Canadian Disney+That\\'s weird, I\\'m in Canada and I watched Mulan II on it about a month ago. They must have removed it since then.They were on there from launch. Must have just been taken off recentlyThat makes sense if they’ve done that, hopefully they someday put both sequels back on Disney+That makes sense,I just mustn’t have ever noticed them.This is the best news I\\'ve heard this month.Damn I haven’t even watched the Simpsons simply for the fact that I’m waiting for the ratio.You just unearthed my memory of this show from a deep pocket of my brain, lol. I loved this as a kid!If *this* [sic.] is so good, why not name it once in your ode, or at least in the title? You just posted a generic item, a placeholder perhaps to try to gain karma?Uhh that wasn\\'t my intention at all. Don\\'t you get karma only based on likes anyway? I don\\'t think you get it via views. No?Keep seeing 1am (UK) being reported.  Not sure how true it is thoughIf you go to disneyplus.com there is a live countdownProbably 1am UK timeWish was midnightIt\\'s 1am, they have a countdown on their website currentlyThanks for the information, mate. So it’d be around 2AM where I live.That’d be awesome. Really can’t wait anymore.I believe the website does go live at midnight. Apps always have a slight delay.I read that it will be active in the morning, written by the DisneyPlus\\' staff on Instagram, not sure if \"2AM\" counts.Ahhh ok 😁They are probably on a scheduled release on the App Store and Google Play so they roll out instantly. Happens at almost 99% of product launches.In quarantine day and night become blurred anyway.I definitely hope so. Past experience has just led to me being prepared for a slightly staggered release over all of the different platforms.Dont think so. The apps are probably updated and uploaded with the respective language packs already on their servers ( Apple and Google ) and just waiting to get released.Imagine pushing prod an hour and a half prior to launchThink wouldn’t matter as their CDN‘s and stuff for the respective countries will not respond.Tron:Legacy if done right would be demo worthy.PotC?They’re just upscaled 4K and crap HDR added.It’s not even worth it.Maybe they are currently downgrading service due to high demand.Pirates of the Carribbean, I think.Pirates of the CaribbeanPirates of the Caribbean. Even though only the 5th one is available on 4k blu-ray, all 5 are in 4k on Disney Plus.Pirates of the CaribbeanPirates of the Caribbean.But Dead Men Tell No Tales won’t be in Dolby Vision/Atmos until Dec. 2, 2020, due to prior agreements.Pirates of the CaribbeanPOTC = Pirates of the CaribbeanSome already are.What is PotCIt\\'s because it\\'s on streaming. Quality is always gonna suffer because they\\'re trying to compress the video as tightly as they can so they don\\'t crush your bandwidth.I’m guessing Pirates of the CaribbeanPirates of the CaribbeanPirates of the CaribbeanPirates of the CaribbeanPirates of the Carribeans?> It came out around the same time as the **PotC** series, and it also is in 4k on Disney+.From OP.Nah they just didn’t bother to put in an effortIt\\'s true on every streaming service. Netflix Hulu and Amazon 4k looks nowhere near as good as even a regular Blu Ray. It\\'s just how streaming works.Nobody else has these issues Interesting factoid: I amSince I Didn\\'t Do It arrived on the 20th and Sonny with a Chance and Just Roll With It will be arriving next month. A.N.T Farm (along with Cory in the House and Dog with a Blog) will arrive in the coming monthsIt’s most likely your internet provider or carrier’s speed.   In this unprecedented time many people are using far more network resources.I haven\\'t heard of D+ being restricted a single device you signed up on.I signed up on my PC, and can access it on my PC, Roku, FireTV, and Android tablet (my phone isn\\'t certified for the app, so I can\\'t download, and probably wouldn\\'t use it much, so I haven\\'t yet taken the time to sideload it).Just use the same email address and password you used when you signed up through your Roku. If you didn\\'t have to provide it, it\\'s probably the same as the email and password you authenticate to Roku with. (This is just a guess, though).If you search for it in the app it says June 25.The issue is that apparently in... 2026, [some things will return to Netflix](https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2474305/disney-and-netflixs-partnership-isnt-permanently-over) and disappear from Disney+. But that contract could change in the coming years.Which country are you in?By that point there would be a lot of content to replace it. But it would still suck. I’m sure Disney’s gonna try to get out of that contract if they can though. It’s a ways off.I\\'m sure they\\'ll get out of that contract somehow.CanadaOhh never mind. It’s on Disney + when it launches on tuesday in the U.K.Unlucky. *laughs in UK*We’re so lucky. We get every Marvel movie except the 2 Spider-Man movies and the Incredible Hulk movieIt\\'s currently not included.  It\\'s in huluNo sadly maybe I\\'m other countries without Hulu though. Even then that could be awhile I\\'m also hoping for Futurma, those two are largely popular too, no idea WHY Disney ignored themIt\\'s not on Disney+ but on a somewhat unrelated topic: Wasn\\'t there talk at some point about Fox making a Bob\\'s Burgers movie and putting that on Disney+?It’s on Netflix if you’re located in Europe.Nope it won’t be everDANG IT!!Most likely the content is too mature.I Mean; It can\\'t be because it\\'s an Adult Show;BECAUSE THEY INCLUDED THE SIMPSONS WITH DISNEY PLUS; AND THAT\\'S NOT A FAMILY-FRIENDLY SQUEAKY-CLEAN-AS-DISNEY SHOW; It\\'s Quite Filthy & DEFINITELY Not for KidsIt won’t be everThey might have to because of the Coronavirus; because the theaters are Closed!! and as such; not even the Most Loyal Bob\\'s Burgers fan is allowed to go to the theaters to see it!!And if enough people watch the Movie on D+; Maybe that would convince Disney to add Bob\\'s burgers to their Line-up; alongside the Simpsons for the more ADULT side of DisneySo is the Simpsons they\\'re inconsistent. Xmen films have f bombs and they\\'re not even censored in the service, Simpsons have many \"over the top\" pretty vulgar episodes too. The movie even shows Bart\\'s damn genitals... It is not \"too mature\". It\\'s just money they care aboutSimpsons is under a different syndication deal than Bob’s BurgersX-Men flims are in the service?I Mean Bob\\'s Burgers is still ongoing; and UNLIKE The Simpsons,  hasn\\'t gone stale after 10 seasons; It\\'s still Well-Done, and It\\'s very Rare to have shows like Bob\\'s BurgersMaybe more Fans should buy Kuchi Kopi Merchandise, and Disney will get the message through their Cash-stuffed EardrumsYes in Canada and some other countries. And the f bombs aren\\'t even censoredALRIIIGHT *Linda Belcher voice*.Seriously though, I love the burger-related puns ;).Thank you!!!I think they\\'re pretty WELL-DONE too!!Usually 1-3 months after it finishes on The Disney Channel.It looks like the final episode aired March 1, so *Rapunzel\\'s Tangled Adventure* season 3 may be on D+ as early as next month.thank you!!You paid for something you can\\'t use the way YOU would like to use it.You preordered.Cancel your order and move on, or accept the current limitations of a service that is less than five months old.There should be no reason for you to reset your devices unless you\\'ve been hacked. Use a strong password and you should be fine.  You can use as many devices as you want, you will just need to type your password in again once you\\'ve reached 10.I understand that are some things missing, but the service comes tomorrow. I think the best you can do is wait and see how it goes.As far as I know is not true that you can only log in on 10 devices, they say that 10 devices can have downloaded content, which is different.And second, if your child by error cancel the account you still have access until your final billing date, like Netflix, Amazon... And then you can resubscribeOnly 10 devices? Oh my god.>What if a child of my family accidentally deletes the account? 60€ suddenly lost due to bad UI???You would not be out of anything if this happens. You\\'ll still have access to the service until your next billing period (a year after your subscription start date in this case).Believe me you are not the only one.There are some things I understand take time such as aspect raitio, uploading new shows and titles cycling until contracts expire.However, there is no excuse for blatantly disregarding basic security practices like viewing account login activity, episode order that could and should be fixed within a week to a month yet hasn’t been touched since launch five months ago and just not giving the customer service team any actual information.That last one is genuinely what angers me the most. Executives are horrible people and stock holders are worse but when you don’t give employees any kind of helpful information that a web search can’t do the same, then you are telling your paid employees that come to work for a living that they do not matter, that their jobs are expendable and that they provide less value then typing in the search box before you’re allowed to even find the number to call them.This is in stark contrast to Netflix especially but even Hulu has this better established and Disney should’ve at least taken a cue from a company it already owns.Those are things you find out once you buy the service and start using it. I am not complaining much about their (in my opinion) crappy policies. Here we are discussion trust and basic transparency... Nothing is clear on that website. Nobody tells you you have a 4 options setting page on which you can\\'t see basic info like MY account activity log or the devices it\\'s logged on... What if someone hacks inside my account for example? I\\'ll never see notice it since you don\\'t even receive an email when someone logs in with itit\\'s not about resetting the devices, it\\'s about logging into different devices. What if i wasn\\'t at home for a night ad I wanted to watch something on disney plus? I just couldn\\'t because the single device i have logged in with is at home and it\\'s my pc. Or also, there are 7 people in my house, 4 of whom with 3 different devices each, who travel a lot for university and such. Why can\\'t they watch disney plus stuff from wherever the hell they want?A toddler shouldn\\'t be handling the app unsupervised anyway.That thing about the 10 devices with downloaded stuff is not written too on the website, but third party every website I checked said the thing i reported in the post. Yes we\\'ll see, but this non transparency is not goodThere\\'s not a 10 device limit. The limit refers to downloads on mobile devices, not how many devices can be associated with an account.If you don\\'t want to cancel your preorder, perhaps consider getting a second account and solve most of the issues.I bet you can afford it.You can absolutely use the device as long as you know the password. There is no limit on the amount of devices you can use. The 10 device limit is only how many can keep the password without typing it in (it also includes how many can have downloaded content).  As long as you know the password, you are good.So, If he wants to watch something I have to watch it with him just because I can\\'t leave it unsupervised since otherwise it could end well? Why do you think there even is the concept of system adminstrator? Here it should be the same. I know how to handle the subscription, a toddler might break everything without even realising itbtw, it\\'s not true, it\\'s 10 device limitI really don\\'t know what to say  You are not even trying to see where is the problem, you just said i can afford to double the subscription cost to get two of them  I pointed out an actual security and contractual issue with a company and you just try to go against me without even trying to understand my point  Have a good oneOn their website, where do I find it?  I couldn\\'t find it anywhere  Send me a link plsJust don’t leave the remote with the toddler... Help them pick a show and then go do what you’re planning to do.That is incorrect. There is no device limit on how many accounts you can log into, only downloads are limited.From [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/disney-plus-screens-how-many-devices-once-screen-limit-1471400)>download movies and TV series on up to 10 mobile devicesFrom [TechHive](https://www.techhive.com/article/3434565/disney-device-streaming-limits-could-be-big-problem.html)>While the company previously said that users would only be able to use 10 devices total, it now says that limit only applies to downloads on mobile devices. “There is no limit on the number of devices that can be associated with your account,” spokeswoman Jessica Casano said.”From [TechHive](https://www.fastcompany.com/90395063/heres-all-the-fine-print-on-the-disney-streaming-service)>Contrary to what Disney told us previously, Disney+ will not have a cap on how many devices subscribers can use.

We’ve updated this story accordingly.From [CNet](https://www.cnet.com/news/disney-plus-everything-to-know-coronavirus-europe-launch-france-delay-frozen-2-onward-pixar/)>Subscribers can download to up to 10 mobile or tablet devices, with no constraints on the number of times a title can be downloaded. The number of titles stored at one time on a device depends on how much storage space is available on the device.Don\\'t preorder a Tesla model S for a family of seven and afterwards complain about the lack of space.

I you want to follow a hype and throw money at it without knowing what you\\'re getting, don\\'t blame the product.https://www.techhive.com/article/3434565/disney-device-streaming-limits-could-be-big-problem.htmlI said toddler but there is also a 14y/o kid  what do I do with him?   He could do something wrong either...See, that\\'s not about the fact that it will happen, it\\'s about the fact that that\\'s something stupid easily solvable but no, it\\'s better to have the risk as your point would suggestI personally contacted the customer service and they told me the exact oppositeOn a tesla model S there is a paper saying that there are n seats  On the Disney plus account terms there is only written that you can create 7 profiles and 4 streams simoultaneous. It\\'s like buying a bus knowing only the fact that it can contain n people, but then after you buy it you find out it\\'s been cut in a half.No dude, i need a [disney.com](https://disney.com) linkbecause i can find you at least one website with the same trust factor which tells the oppositeAnd trust me, I researched a lot todayEdit: i read what\\'s in the link and... are you saying I am right? I don\\'t think I understand your point anymoreThey are misinformed. The wording used to be on the FAQ that there was a 10 device limit, and that caused confusion. That has since been removed and there is only wordage that there is a 4 device for streaming at the same time. The spokesperson (who is way above Customer Service) literally clarified what they meant by 10 devices. I am logged into more than 10 devices and I was not locked out after adding above 10 devices.I also want to add, that I found specifically on the Disney+ FAQ regarding the 10 devices.From [Disney+](https://help.disneyplus.com/csp?id=csp_article_content&sys_kb_id=06a562dcdbc940d03c0cf158bf9619ec)>You can download the same title as many times as you want on up to 10 devices, provided you have storage space available on your individual device.I\\'m referring to the update:  UPDATE: Disney now says that it misspoke in response to questions earlier this week about device activation limits for Disney+. While the company previously said that users would only be able to use 10 devices total, it now says that limit only applies to downloads on mobile devices. “There is no limit on the number of devices that can be associated with your account,” spokeswoman Jessica Casano said.”Which is exactly what I am pointing outA serious company doesn\\'t do thisA serious company knows it\\'s policiesA serious company lets you decide whether a device has to be removed from the list in the account settingsIt\\'s still something they have to work onFor sure they\\'ll have to train their customer serviceYeah, ok, so nothing is sure  But still, i see nothing on their website, how should I know my restrictions?They are a serious company. It\\'s a new service. Kinks have to be worked out. They are working on them. If you don\\'t want to have the service until all the kinks are fixed, cancel and come back. No company has come out with a service that was perfect on day one. Do you think when Netflix launched it\\'s streaming it was perfect? No. It takes time to change things.This may be a latency issue with your internet connection. I have a relatively slow connection (30 Mbps) that I stream on multiple devices and services with. I have never seen an issue with D+. If you have a faster speed look at the latency when doing a speed test, if it is high then that is your problem. Google will help with the rest and fixes.I have exactly the same problem. Netflix, Hulu, Amazon all stream without any problem (in 4K within seconds) but Disney+ cant go higher than 1080p and often drops at 360p. I have sometimes video but no sound for like 10 seconds...I have 930 Mbps and 2ms for the lantency... Really weird.I’ve done multiple speed test, even have a new router which fixed my online gaming issues. Speed test is fine, over 100 mbps and only 10 ms latency. I stream Hulu, Netflix, vudu, and amazon and have 0 problems.Yeah I’ve been casting it to my tv from my phone, seems to work better 😂What application do you use for internet?Tried that, but same problem. Sometimes, it works fine, sometimes, same as on the Apple TV. So annoying...Are you asking who my internet provider is? It’s Spectrum.No, sorry, I couldn\\'t remember the term web browser at the time.I\\'ve had luck with better playback on Microsoft Edge over Google Chrome because I was having some lagging and sound sync problems when using chrome. Give it a shot.I’ve used google speed test and Ookla on safari, chrome and the Ookla speed test app on Mac OS. I’ve also used the Ookla app on my phone. With Netflix streaming 4K without any problems and Disney+ usually has some issues 80% of the time. Even if it’s just a loss of “smoothness” to the stream for a second. Or the picture stops and audio continues. Random freeze ups, etc. latency fluctuated 10-15 me. Speed is usually 150-230 download and 10-15 upload.Oh I see you meant to stream. I rarely stream from my computer or a browser. 99% of the time it’s my smart tv or a gaming console.Yeah but just give it a shot, I was having the same problem but no problems with any other streaming, just Disney+, there\\'s a technical reason that someone else might be able explain sadly I don\\'t know any of the technical, I just know this was a fix to the problem.Oh, ignore what I said thenI appreciate the tip! Thanks!It\\'ll never be everything, because they\\'re not going to put adult content on, or stuff like Song of the South. But it will probably eventually be everything they deem appropriate that they own the rights to, once they get the streaming rights back from whoever currently holds them. There might be some holdouts where music rights or production quality or something else keeps them off the service, though.My *opinion* is that they will still license things where there is money to be made. If some other company like Netflix offers them a big enough check, they will take the cash. I don’t think they will take anything off Disney+ that is on there now, but especially with FOX television properties, I would say they might license them instead of just putting them on Hulu.Either way it\\'s the greatest Disney show that has ever been made.Yes, they are out of order. \"Rollercoaster\" is the first episode.The sorting in the app is still really bad.Yes the whole first season is out of order but every other season is finePreachI 100% agree.Phineas and Ferb is great, but you can’t beat Gravity FallsOh, awesome!I did also seriously enjoy gravity falls. But I connected with Phineas and Ferb. It was my imagination when I was a kid that was then made into a show. It made my life. HahahahaI download the mickey mouse shorts. They\\'re short and funny, makes me laugh.Well, The Simpsons have replay value. Luckily you don\\'t have to download all the seasons as their golden years were from season 2-10.All of the Disney Renaissance and origanal made by Walt Disney moviesEpisodes of old series like darkwing duck gargoyles or talespin.Funny and short. Sounds like you are describing life. That’s exactly what I need in this pandemic tho.Season 9 was peak.So would you recommend all seasons 3-10 for download.The newer episodes are still pretty goodSure, I did. Like someone else said, The Simpsons still have funny episodes since their golden years, but the seasons I mentioned have consistency. I have few series downloaded onto my phones SD card and it\\'s The Simpsons, All Harry Potter and Star Wars movies, The Office, HYMYM and Parks and Recs. I suppose those are my essentials.Yes!!! Lloyd in space and Dave the Barbarian. I\\'m glad someone else remembers these*Dinosaurs* (1991-1994)*Bear in the Big Blue House* (1997-2006)And everything Muppets that isn\\'t already on there.I’d love to have the Wonderful World of Disney show from the ‘70s.FillmorePlease reach out to Disney and make sure they understand we want this content! I have been doing that for 4 months now... hope now that D+ launches in other European markets we’ll have more people to make this message clear!100% agree on Buzz Lightyear. Would also love The Weekenders to be added.Malcolm in the MiddleThey could really expand their shows for older families to really justify the cost.They have the Simpson’s, so other shows in that vein shouldn’t be off the table. Shows like Modern Family, Bob’s Burgers, Blackish, Fresh off the Boat, etc.Dog with a BlogAll stellar choices, but to be honest, Hercules and Talespin are getting binged in the first week! I\\'ve been so hyped on The Mandolorian, Jeff Goldblum, The Simpsons, and The Imagineer, I\\'ve not thought of all the absolute classics that will or in fact should be on there! I\\'m also hoping for Honey I Shrunk The Kids tv show - that would be awesome!I need the old educational films narrated by Ludwig von Drake.Futurama please?Danger BayDisney originally aired it in the US, but it\\'s a Canadian show, show I doubt they\\'d pay for the rights.Disney: Dave the Barbarian, Dinosaurs, House of Mouse, Mickey Mouse Works, Wonder Over Yonder, Pepper Ann, Buzz Lightyear of Star Command, The Wuzzles, Most in-house Disney owned Jetix shows, Wonderful World of Color episodes.Fox: Malcolm in the Middle, Here Come the Double Deckers, Journey to the Center of the Earth and Fantastic Voyage Fox/Filmation adaptations, The Tracey Ullman Show, Capitol Critters, 1969\\'s The Hardy Boys cartoon.The list goes on.....I\\'ve been thinking about 90s shows lately and I was thinking about Space: Above and Beyond.  It was done by Fox and I would like to see more 90s Sci fi shows available on any streaming service.Once Upon a Time.Bluey! X-Men Evolution.Can you give me the link to suggest these shows? I keep on hearing about it but I can\\'t find anywhere to suggest this to.Bob\\'s Burger\\'s is owned by Viacom.[deleted]They can\\'t be binged here.I could be confused, but isn’t it owned by Fox (and so Disney)?Bob\\'s burgers is a fox propertyThat’s insane. Tailspin I don’t mind, but Hercules! 😫It\\'s on Comedy Central.Hate to burst your bubble: TaleSpin and Hercules will probably not be available in the UK. We don’t have them in the Netherlands either... for some reason Disney doesn’t want to make them available here.Please reach out to Disney and make sure they understand we want this content! I have been doing that for 4 months now... hope now that D+ launches in other European markets we’ll have more people to make this message clear!From Wikipedia: “Bob\\'s Burgers is a joint production by Bento Box Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television and syndicated by 20th Television.”Generally the production studio owns the show, not the channel that airs it.But the commissioning channel may have a holdback, or may have bought an exclusive SVOD license for a period of time.But it\\'s absolutely a Fox show. Indeed, Fox air it on their own channels in many parts of the world, though Disney don\\'t own those channels.I tried to, but they just give me generic messages like:  \"Disney Plus has an assortment of shows and Movies, as well as 30 seasons of The Simpsons.\"You an do two things:1.\\t\\u2060on their support site there is the option to request content. I have been repeatedly requesting content from the following list (all titles that have been available in the US since launch):•\\t\\u2060The Rescuers•\\t\\u2060Bonkers•\\t\\u2060TaleSpin•\\t\\u2060About 50 classic cartoons that are available in other markets•\\t\\u2060Lizzie McGuire•\\t\\u2060Hercules series•\\t\\u2060The Emperor’s New School•\\t\\u2060Mickey’s Christmas Carol•\\t\\u2060A Kid in King Arthur’s Court•\\t\\u2060Flight of the Navigator•\\t\\u2060My Dog, the Thief•\\t\\u2060Mickey Mouse Club (1955)•\\t\\u2060The Adventures of Spin and Marty•\\t\\u2060Disneyland Through the Seasons1.\\t\\u2060Don’t contact your local UK support team; contact the US support team (content decisions for all markets are made in Disney’s headquarters in Burbank). Explain that you are from Europe and that you don’t understand why the list of titles was not made available in Europe. When they give you the ‘licensed to other parties’ excuse, point out that this is total nonsense for at least the old titles (such as the 1955 Mickey Mouse Club). Stay polite; the support person can’t help it of course :-)What, we don\\'t even get Lizzie McGuire?! >:(How do I contact the US team? Also, I can\\'t see the option to request a cartoon.Sorry, this is a Dutch list, some stuff on it the UK will get.In the Disney+ app, you can select the option to contact the help desk and select a country.The option to request content is also in the app (under Feedback).Man, now would be a great time for streaming companies to add HEVC and/or AV1 codecs to their codec lineup. Then serve those codecs up to the devices that are capable of hardware accelerating them, instead of h264/AVC. That in itself would be a massive reduction in bandwidth with no psychovisual quality difference.Is US suffering from bandwidth problems too? Haven’t noticed any issues here in California.Their bandwidth already sucks so bad though. I have Netflix hulu and hbo as well and Disney is the only service that stutters and lags. It\\'s so bad.You guys are only losing bandwidth. In India, the launch has been put off.At least they have a release date unlike south america.Disney+ is starting to get worse and worse. The thrill is gone.I have no idea what the nerd you just said, but I agree!Article only says they are doing it in markets where they debuting on March 24. Which is the UK and EUThey can\\'t even get their app login to load properly.In this case, \"bandwidth\" is referring to a temporary reduction in video quality, not buffering.I haven’t seen any streaming video service stutter or lag since before 2010. I think something’s a miss on your end.They\\'re only doing this in the EU.Not for me.You realise that most streaming services are reducing their streaming quality,  cause so many people are at home all day now? It\\'s not an indefinite decision and apparently the French government asked for the delay.I also have no idea what he/she said, but it sounds smart so I’ll go with it!Basically, more modern video codecs can give the same perceived visual quality at far lower bitrates, thus less bandwidth used (sometimes half). Though not all devices can support efficient playback yet (aka hardware acceleration) though a considerable amount can, enough to have an effect.Being downvoted for something that\\'s true.No, no. Disney plus is failure. That one grumpy internet guy said so.Middle out then?Welp, you heard it here first.  That’s a wrap folks, no more Disney+Are you in the U.S.? There have been a few posts stating that \"forced subtitles,\" as they are known, aren\\'t showing up in some countries.Yes I am in the US and that is exactly the issue I am having. Was there a resolution to this?Why not just allow us to lower our streaming resolution. 😐They’ve flat out removed any mention of 4K from their online advertising.might help if they stopped forcing 4K streams on people and rather had variable rate streaming based on the device and available bandwidth.France will have to fait until 7th april...I can live without 4K for a bit but any lower than 1080p then I\\'ma cry.Can someone ELI5?\\\\*prays this doesn\\'t happen in the US\\\\*The worst part is they throw the UK into this despite our ISPs saying we have barely even hit 70% towards the max capacity 🙄 most ISPs have their own CDNs for these services so hopefully the ones that can \"cope\" will still allow for 4k streams...This sucks, I\\'ve been waiting for half a year to finally see the 4k versions of Star Wars and now this. So annoying.[deleted]Idk if kids are out of school in Europe but if they are this is 100% the way to piss off parentsdont care about 4k but would really suck if i have to stream in 720p quality :(Wouldn’t taking away streaming give people a reason to leave self quarantine? The simpsons is one of the only things keeping me sane right nowIf you cut off streaming services people WILL leave their homes. They should be cutting off video conferencing first. No one needs to see your face for a conference call.This is how it starts, then they start asking us to lower our power and water consumption.Good luck I lived in Asiawhy not just deprioritize video data? every mobile carrier already does that? if its 3 am and there is no one using the internet, why not let me stream in 4k, as opposed to when it is 9 am and everyone is busy, then throttle it.They should release the entire season of “The Mandalorian“ to compensate the lack of 4K.Read about Netflix, Amazon and Apple doing the same thing the other day. Haven’t seen any drop in quality for all of those streaming services though. Still everything looks exactly the same as before.“In Europe” phewWhy does America not get all these streaming limits imposed as well? A lot of them are currently working from home too.My understanding is that the EU is trying to limit \"entertainment\" Internet bandwidth to ensure there\\'s enough Internet to go around when the current Italian situation starts to cover the rest of the continent >_>.If you\\'re watching on a mobile device, you can download to it to watch later.Do you really think people would actively *choose* to watch something in a lower resolution?I notice they aren\\'t lowering their prices.Woah really no 4k content at launch? This is so frustratingThat’s a bit disappointing as I’ve been holding off on a Star Wars rewatch to watch them in 4K.Why, aren\\'t they still launching next week in France?House of Mouse shows it cannot manage the crisisThere are sacrifices we can make during this time. Not going out, not using toilet paper, but STANDARD DEF? what are we, animals?Disney+ will lower the bitrate (thus quality in terms of resolution 1080p or lower) to reduce the overall strain on the internet since so many people are at home working or wanting to see a movie. This should help stop the so called internet congestion.Data caps/limits should prevent this from happening hereI swear it already did. I was trying to watch The last Jedi last night and it looked like crap. I had to rent it from Google play movies and it looked a million times betterWhich I why I sincerely hope for an eventual Mandalorian physical releaseGood luck buying physical media with all the stores being CLOSED.Plex!*Laughs in local Plex server*Parents and kids don\\'t care about having it in 1080m instead of 4k.Yeah while we\\'re all isolating we definitely shouldnt be using video chat for human interaction we should strictly stream movies and TV instead!Yes. There is such continent in case you didn\\'t take lessons at schoolBecause it\\'s a move by a politician to try to look good and has no basis in reality?When did we start running out of internet? WtfWell... why not both? Lower resolution will help limit bandwidth and while not limiting the quantity of entertainment.Thats why in crisis you must rely on radio and satelite services for broadcasting emergency messages not just internet. even if internet is down satelite works.Yes. It has literally been posted on this sub multiple times by different people. A simple search on google or reddit shows that there are many people asking how to set or lower the resolution. One of the reasons they ask, once again, is that 4K streaming takes a huge chunk of data. For those of us with data caps, yes, we do want to lower the resolution. It saves us money. I also think that people would actively choose to select a lower resolution that is equivalent to what their screen can show. Case in point, if I use Disney+ with my PS4 it will use a higher resolution than my tv can show. Why stream in 4k when my tv can’t even display it? This conserves bandwidth, and as previously stated, saves money for those of us with data caps.Their monthly pricing is already on par with Netflix\\'s lowest tier, which doesn\\'t even offer HD or multiple screens. How much lower do you expect Disney to go?Why would they? It\\'s a temporary measure for safety4k with the predicted bandwidth situation, would be like advertising \"toilet paper guns\"Rest of europe is still on but apparently the french government requested they delay the launchThank you! So the quality will be reduced? How bad do you think it will be (1080 instead of 4k or like 720 across the board)?Because it is crap. Sorry, had to insert my hardcore SW feelings in and it was such a sweet setup. As for quality, I viewed A New Hope and it looked crisp with Dolby Vision and Atmos. Could just be per area.Entertainment stores were open in the UK today. Bought Mario Kart 8 and God of War at last.Limiting streaming traffic sounds like it means less people can be on the service not that they view it as a lower quality, effectively some people will just get a queue to wait in before they can watchI\\'m not saying it\\'s a good idea by any means. I\\'m only wondering why the EU seems to think the internet\\'s running out and the US doesn\\'t.We’re heading out Californee way. I hear they got a whole mess of internet.The way to look at the internet is like a water main. All water goes through a pipe(internet). This pipe is rated for a certain pressure and throughput(Bandwidth/speed). Under normal circumstances office buildings put less strain on the water main than residential. Same is true for a well configured office network with caching. So the way to look at it is a building water tank is similar to a server. One inlet for the building and that handles multiple units. If the building exceeds the main/internet then the strain is only internal as there is a physical cap on how fast the pipe/wire to the main is. No other building is affected by joe flushing every toilet or downloading the office on every work computer.Now everyone has to work from home. Kids are learning on chrome books with video, university students are using webex/google meets/blackboard/etc, and work now needs video conferencing. The equivalent to the water pipe is imagine trying to fill the sink and tub at the same time for every home. There is a physical limit to how much water can go through a pipe and too many people using it lowers the pressure for each house to a point that you may get enough water to fill a cup in maybe a minute. That is why we are \"running out of internet\". The main copper/fiber just can\\'t have that much data going through it. By lowering the bitrate of video you are cutting back how much data is needed to send the video.Because how many people would actually voluntarily reduce their quality?Maybe you would, but the vast majority would not, and that’s why it’s being imposed on everyone.Although I suspect a lot of people would also choose 4k because it\\'s \"better\"even if watching on a screen that does not have that resolution.I don\\'t think it\\'s safety lolNo problem, happy to explain. Not sure what they will do exactly but I think we won\\'t be getting any 4K quality. Maybe not even 1080P. We\\'ll see I guessEven Netflix has plans (or already put them it in effect) to reduce the quality. They said it\\'s going to still look watchable, so I guess it will be 720p and Disney probably will be the same.Netflix didn\\'t reduce resolution, just reduced the bitrate a bit.I imagine they\\'ll do the same on D+I know the stores are open in many places still, but i was just exaggerating a little, because the comment of the person I replied to was silly. Yes right now you can still buy physical media, but you won\\'t be when the government order those stores closed. So his stance on physical media during an epidemic is silly.Also wth took you so long? Enjoy your time, should help make this crazy times a bit more bearable.I\\'m curious to know too. Someone thinks things are overly congested but why?Over in North America I know the Netflix, steam and I\\'m sure others make servers available to ISPs so data is served at the edge of where the ISP and greater internet meet. So it shouldn\\'t be that hard on the backbone of the internet. I have no idea how Disney is setup.It\\'s a series of tubes!Once again, why not both? If I can limit my resolution, I can download/stream more content with a bandwidth limit/cap. Which I currently do as my isp is not unlimited. Having the option to lower resolution (which most other streaming services have) allows users at anytime to lower their bandwidth usage. The lack of a resolution setting is a common complaint about Disney +. I’ve seen it mentioned in this subreddit many times. So while there are people who are not going to voluntarily reduce their resolution, there are also people who want too. Even before COVID-19.Having the internet open? Partly it is, yeah, it\\'s an invaluable communication method and information resource.I have to work still and usually am socialising so don’t play games. It’s not a silly point. We’re paying for access to a library with streaming services. If they change what’s in that library you lose access. That’s why physical media is best. Once you own it, it’s yours. Obviously there’s illegal ways to watch but whilst operating in the confines of the law, physical is best.The internet is not a big truck.Even without a cap there should be resolution options.I live in Canada and have an unlimited plan, my parents, my brother and I, each stream our own shows now that we are all quarantined and I\\'ve noticed a lot of hiccups. I switched to 480p on YouTube and the videos play smoothly even with my parents and brother streaming in HD. But Disney+ is still forcing HD streaming. I\\'ve had to download episodes on my phone to watch later...WhatWhat, what?What, what, what?Sorry I\\'m not helping lol I was just really confused by your statement. How would it affect the internet? Wouldn\\'t it just affect their servers?Internet is not an unlimited resource, and  servers are only part of the system. You can still overwhelm local bandwidth.Video makes up the majority of internet traffic nowadays and Netflix (and likely Disney now) are some of the biggest resource hogs. Having millions of people at home streaming more than usual can put a strain on internet access.Maybe never? That doesn’t seem like a feature that many are asking for.Aw I’d hope so i think if it does happen will be a long time2 episodes on Tuesday then 2 on Friday. 2 each Friday until episode 10.  Will then air in sync with the US for the last 2 episodesI’m from the USA and I don’t really understand why they aren’t releasing The Mandalorian all at once for everyone else. It’s just a bad move in my opinion, they would get more brownie points by letting everyone be able to catch up with the US, especially since there’s no need to dub languages for the UK.Thanks! Do you have a source?It’s not an ideal situation but at least the ending episodes would be concurrent with the US.Thank you!! It’s super annoying.At the end of the day they don’t want people to stay for the free trial then cancel, but they should at least release a few episodes per week rather than one by one!! Clone Wars is still running in the US though, so I’m really hoping that it will be released at the same times.https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a31783698/disney-plus-uk-launch-mandalorian-episodes-release/I think a compromise would be to release two episodes a week, instead of just one. I heard they’re doing that for the new clone wars season, so we’ll see what happens.Thanks!!This would be much better.If your only interested in Star Wars content I’ll just wait and then buy a month or two subscription>  I\\'m not a huge Marvel fan, I don\\'t watch Disney\\'s animated movies generally, and whilst I like Pixar\\'s stuff, I don\\'t go out of my way to watch it. Ir doesn\\'t really sound like you are going to like an annual subscription. Stick to the monthly. If you later decide that there is enough content to make it worth an annual subscription for you, then sign up for that later.Yes, because it\\'s £4.2 per month with the discount. Additionally, the discount for the service is up until tomorrow.Sadly though, several shows won\\'t make it for the UK or Europe. These are: Bonkers, Talespin, Hercules, Emperor\\'s New School, The Replacements, Bluey and The Proud Family.I went for the annual purely because there is quite a lot I really want to see (Imagineers, Jeff Goldblum, Mandalorian, Clone Wars, One Day at Disney) and with the back catalogue of Pixar, MCU and classic Disney, I think they’ll always be something I’d like to watch. Who doesn’t want to watch Finding Nemo the morning after a few gins 🤣. For £4 a month, that deal was a steal, let’s just hope they keep up the momentum with the originals.~£1 a week is absolutely fine by me.Quick update - I subscribed yesterday. Thanks for all the comments. The service when live this morning, so I\\'ll be watching The Mandalorian in about 4 hours!Btw can I watch the mandalorian without having watched any stars wars movie/tv series beforehand?nooo!!! not emperors new schoolI was looking forward to watching those old Disney shows, like Talespin, when Disney+ is released in Norway this summer… Do you think they will ever be available in Europe?I\\'ve only watched the first two episodes and so far I\\'d say its fine for people who haven\\'t seen any Star Wars content before but you will get much more out of it if you watch the Original Trilogy (4,5 & 6) first since the series takes places after Return of the Jedi. They are all on Disney+ so you might as well binge the movies firstI don\\'t know. I know that someone here had a theory that they cut those shows due to there needing to be a certain % of EU originals.I really hope that’s not the case. If they do, then they’re no better than netflix and their region-blocked content.At least Netflix has region specific content for the UK though. We get Always Sunny earlier and Horrible Histories.I don’t know if they have region specific content in Norway. But I do know we get less than half of the content available in the US for the same price. If it’s going to be the same with Disney+ then I’m dissapointed.Bandwidth on Disney+ has taken a huge hit since everyone is home and quarantined.Check your router logs. It should show you if the tv connects and if any traffic goes through.Unplug TV, unplug direct connection. Wait 60 seconds. Plug in direct connection, plug in TV?Try reseting your password?Does it matter if I am able to connect to other apps (Netflix/Hulu)?It matters a bit. If you can connect to the other apps, it could still be that the Disney Plus app tries to connect to a non-existing site, or giving other firewall related problems.-\\tUninstall the Disney Plus app;-\\tReboot the TV (unplug it);-\\tReinstall the app;-\\tRestart (turn off/on);-\\tTry Netflix first;-\\tTry Disney PlusThat should work, clearing app caches, etc. Also installing the latest version.THANK YOU!!!! The TV reboot worked.  My Granddaughters thank youIf the downloads are available on the device you\\'re using, expect them to be HD at best, for now, within the EU.I’ve been having this problem with my fire stick too. It used to work and then when they put frozen2 on it won’t work now.  I can get it on my smart tv. Same sign in and WiFi so don’t know why. All I figured out it was when they put frozen2 on was when mine when caputHaving this problem, too. Works fine on my Xbox. But I can\\'t login for last three days.I had not even thought of that... it had been working fine, although it had been a while since I used it last (The Mandalorian).Does playing through the browser on your chrome book not work?Downloaded video from Disney Plus can only be played on the device itself.Screwed you are.I’ll try that next thanksLicense is probably stuck somewhere on a different streaming service.I read somewhere November it would come onHere\\'s hoping this, *Dinosaurs* (1991-1994),  and all other Disney Muppets content come to Disney+.[removed]That\\'s the most likely outcome. ThanksWhy would it be? Disney bought Henson\\'s productions. Plus a lot of Muppet movies are on there, including ones made before Disney owned them.Did it have a date?Dinosaurs is the one thing I’ve been waiting so impatiently for, lolI was talking about exclusive streaming licenses that were made before D+ was announced and open. There’s a lot of Disney content stuck in streaming licenses still. Once they expire they will be moved. Or could be a music licensing issue.Disney didn\\'t buy Henson Productions, they just bought the muppets.Think it was 27th 😀It can\\'t be music related, because all music for the show is unique to it.Disney might not own it though even if unique to the show. It’s all about how it was written in the contract for the song writers.Disney’s marketing materials are the only source you should be trusting in advance of a launch...App will available at launch dateCheck Disney web site as I HEARD they were going to delay the release in France at least. https://deadline.com/2020/03/disney-reduces-bandwidth-delays-french-debut-1202889432/amp/Sorry to be the bearer of bad news!Yes that is possibleThanksIn germany it should be on timeThere will be PS4 support, but if you do a search here, you’ll find a LOT of complaints about the PS4 app. It just hasn’t been as staple as the others.French government asked Disney+ to delayFirestick should be fine for the UK! In general, any features available currently will also be available on your launch tomorrow :)On paper it should be on the Firestick and will definitely be there on day 1 as an app to download. But those in the US seem to report issues with it all the time. Add that together with teething issues on the first week and yoh may run into issues. Maybe have a backup on a console or smart tv just in case. It could be thought that UK firesticks work better for this than US ones, who knowsCory in the House is coming soon.NoNopeThey have some of the marvel animesUnfortunately not. Was really hoping Ghibli would be on it. Maybe in a couple of years.I\\'d give you an award if I had the coinsdo they have the dio deadpool onemaybe yeahThe Ghibli movies will be on HBO Max.I know. Hence why I said a couple of years.What the...No.Plz comment ur responsesOn my fire tv, this is a setting you handle in the main settings menu of the tv itself. Not the Disney plus menu. Best luck!Last night I watched one of my favorite childhood classics, Robin Hood. It still holds up and is a fun, short and sweet tale. I\\'ve also still been working on my watch through of Boy Meets World. Taking my time with that one as it\\'s pure nostalgia for me.Anyone know for the U.K. launch if it’ll be midnight Monday or Tuesday the next morning?I recently started High School Musical: The Musical: The Series. It\\'s pretty good.The Plausible Impossible - an episode of *Disneyland* from 1956 about the animation process, the stuff that isn’t recycled is gold.  The Old Mill - best classic short currently streaming.Me too! Just checked I think it’s 1am*Phineas and Ferb* (and movie)*, Milo Murphy\\'s Law,* and *Kim Possible* (and the animated movie)And everything Muppets!Just re-watched *Lady and the Tramp* and *101 Dalmatians*. I don\\'t know what it is, but the classic animated dog-based movies have always gotten to me. Nostalgia hits hard folks.I rewatched **Captain America: The Winter Soldier** last night. I\\'ve seen it multiple times before and really it\\'s pretty much the only Marvel movie that I like enough to rewatch multiple times.I\\'m a big fan of military/spy thrillers and Winter Soldier works pretty well as one of those without relying on the Marvel Studios appeal. There are only a few things about the movie that kind of bother me:1. Black Widow acts like a bratty teenager in this movie and it\\'s really annoying.2. A few weird things that break the sense of realism in a way that make it too hard to suspend my disbelief, like the physics of Cap\\'s shield and the part where Nick Fury uses that pocket-sized blowtorch to burn a large hole through 6 inches of solid concrete in a couple seconds.Overall though, I love the movie and if they had just trimmed off some of the Whedon-esque fat from the dialogue(which I know they couldn\\'t do because that\\'s where the Marvel appeal comes from) then it would be a nearly perfect military/spy thriller.Is it weird that the main things I\\'m looking to are The Imagineering Story and The World According to Jeff Goldblum?Don\\'t get me wrong, I can\\'t wait for The Mandolorian, One Day at Disney, Lion King etc. but the idea of looking behind the curtain is really exciting. Not really keen on HSMTM, but I\\'ll try it.Mine went from English to German on its own.....I have been enjoying some Halloweentown, That\\'s So Raven, Lizzie McGuire, Even Stevens, Zenon, and Stuck in the Suburbs from the comfort of my \"home office.\"Going of the countdown on the website it looks like it\\'s going to be 1am Tuesdayoliver and company is an all time favorite of mine, one of the grimiest looking and darkest Disney moviesJeff Goldblum is a national treasure, your mind is in the right place.Just found [this](https://www.justwatch.com/uk/provider/disney) and now I\\'m excited. Tron Legacy, Treasure Planet, Agent Carter, One Strange Rock, Inhumans, Recess (!), Atlantis (!!). I wasn\\'t expecting all of that on that list, and for £4 p/m, it\\'s getting binged especially if we\\'re locked up for 3 months!Cheers :) I didn’t think to check that lol I’ll have a look nowNo problem, happy streaming. So excited myself :) :)Does that mean the apps should be available straight away? I really hope soI hope so, I think sky had a recent update waiting for Disney to release to push the app. For the consoles/phones/tablets it should be an easy app to put through to us since they are available to other regions alreadyWhich show? Which season?Star vs the forces of evil season 3Not working on my Sony smart TV but can still cast from my iPhone to the same tv.Same deal. Qled65 and cant get it to work...Ah, disappointing.we have been having this issue for a couple weeks now...I have the same issueBut I just uninstalled and reinstalled the app and I’m good to goFixed itself the next day. Might have just been a server thing.I\\'ll try thatThe current UK launch day is Tuesday, 24 March. From that date onwards, it should be okay.I don\\'t think so[removed]**Please read this entire message**---> Your comment on r/DisneyPlus was removed due to a Rule 2 violation: \"No posts about piracy or VPNs.\" ---**If you believe this post was removed by mistake, please [contact the Moderators.](https://reddit.com/message/compose/?to=r/disneyplus&subject=Question%20About%20A%20Removal)****Violations may result in a temporary or permanent ban.**[removed]I can not help you, as I am in the same position but I get the impression you have already got your answer, I am looking forward to using Disney+ to improve my German.

If French audio is available in places like the US, Australia or New Zealand, then I would feel fairly safe predicting that it will be available in Ireland.In the Netherlands we got German, French, French (Canadian),  Italian and Spanish (Latin-American) audioI think there\\'s a big chance these will be available in the rest of Western Europe.The \"discount\" means you pay in full in advance. If you don\\'t like Disney Plus, it\\'s a lot cheaper to cancel your monthly account within the **free** week - or whenever you like - saving a lot more.Fantastic, that\\'s just what I was hoping for!Well that’s stupid. Releasing it early could persuade people to self-isolate properly.\"Encore un peu de patience pour nos fans français, notre service de streaming Disney+ arrive bientôt… mais à la demande du @GouvernementFR, nous avons convenu de reporter le lancement jusqu\\'au mardi 7 avril 2020. #DisneyPlus\"   >publisher: @DisneyPlusFRI swear to god Boris, don’t even think about it!Very stupid as usual. Vive la république i guessObviously, they want to ensure the internet remains functional through this time.He wouldn\\'t need to the UK has more than enough bandwidth but for some reason we are being roped into the EU BS.You are correct, but it\\'s not obvious to selfish people.You mean like Netflix or YouTube , who are both operating during this period, and compose 13% of all internet traffic EACH? If there’s enough bandwidth for them, there should be enough for for Disney. They should have allowed it to launch with reduced bitrate as the other providers haven’t even reduced quality (only bitrate) as of yet.Selfish people who\\'re in lockdown at home and would like to do something beyond staring at the walls for 18 hours a day.the decision came from Orange the french network operator...btw orange has its own VOD service... and spoiler alert..it is still working...Netflix has reduced quality in Europe reducing bandwidth by 30pctSo they’re using 9% of the internet now, still a huge amount. I did mention in my comment also that they reduced bitrate which Disney should have been allowed to do also.This was already posted, with explanation:**[Disney+ To Reduce Bandwidth By 25 Percent, Delays France Launch Until April 7](https://reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/fmvy3w/disney_to_reduce_bandwidth_by_25_percent_delays/)**Unlike Netflix or Amazon,  it doesn\\'t seem as if they\\'re reducing bitrate, it seems as if they\\'ll just remove HD/UHD availability.Yes, but there was no detail of what the reduced Bandwidth would imply.Disney is going in a completely different direction than Netflix, Amazon, and Apple.You\\'re incorrect. [Mashable](https://mashable.com/article/youtube-amazon-prime-video-stream-quality-coronavirus/?europe=true) has more details. Disney Plus was just more specific on the impact for its users.Amazon, and Netflix are reducing Bitrate whilst still making 4k and HD Content available. YouTube is switching to SD default.Disney is the only one restricting availability to HD/4k content. That information is not on Mashable.But the support response that you\\'re citing as an absolute clad-iron proof isn\\'t clear either. What does \"in some cases\" mean here? Just about everything is at least HD, so this phrasing makes it sound as if Disney will pick and choose.A live action Ahsoka, next to my baby yoda? Yes please!Rosario Dawson is officially the queen of streaming! Was sad about the Netflix/Marvel universe coming to an end but this role will be ten times better.I hope this is real. Best news of 2020.From 3 years ago: https://twitter.com/GMA/status/855400688389455873?s=09Yay!!!!Everyone liked that.Oh yesFor a franchise that geographically spans an entire galaxy, it sure seems like unaffiliated characters sure do run into each other a lot. I am not complaining. I love Ahsoka as a character, I love The Mandalorian as a show and I love Rosario Dawson (maybe literally).I am excited.Shouldn’t she be looking for Ezra with Sabine?[deleted][deleted][deleted]Spoilers much?&#x200B;Why\\'d they let that bit of info loose?First movie I saw her in was Clerks 2 and I loved her performances ever since.I find she’s always criminally underused. I’m so happy for all of us!When it comes to entertainment news, a story being reported by Variety is as close to an official confirmation as you can get outside of an actual press release from the studio.r/agedlikewineInteresting how the Star Wars twitter followed Dawson’s twitter three years ago.well, in season one of mandolorian, they say they’re gonna get baby yoda trained in the force. who better than ahsoka?Why not at least wait to see Rosario Dawson\\'s take on the character before making your mind up about it?I mean... Yeah. She\\'s in Rebels so that was already known.Well yeah, she\\'s not a Jedi anymore.OofIt’s not a spoiler to the creators if they wanted to reveal it. She must have an important role.I ate at that Moobys in Clerks 2(well it was a Burger King before it closed down.)I love Rosario Dawson in almost anything I see her in.Supporting this for passers by: Variety isn’t a news publication in the traditional sense, they’re an industry publication. As a result, they don’t do investigative reporting (that traditional publications can sometimes get things wrong if they’re rushing to print) and they don’t have an opinion section (which is the section most likely to exhibit bias). All they do is report industry news accurately. It’s important to have a firm place to stand. Facts reported in industry publications are solid. As are news reporting in top-ranked newspapers like WaPo, NYT, WSJ, and FT. Opinion should always be read as such. Facts in lesser publications should be checked against better publications. But that’s way too much work a lot of the time, especially for a news report of a casting in a streaming show. So, if you know what Variety is and that you can trust it, it makes life much easier.This is the way.[deleted]I haven’t seen Rebels.You can share your opinion all you want. That doesn\\'t mean other people have to like or agree with your opinion. That\\'s kinda what the whole \"downvote\" thing is for.Watch it, it’s an extremely satisfying arc for her character. And it concludes Darth Maul’s story. I think there’s an “essential” episode guide floating around somewhere on reddit that skips filler episodes.Must watch![deleted]And that\\'s your prerogative. I think your opinion is an incredibly bad take so yeah... Gonna downvote you.I haven\\'t but buffering shouldn\\'t be surprising considering the whole coronavirus thingIt’s been buffering for two days for me now. Hulu & Netflix are fine.I haven’t had any issues on multiple devices in my home. I’d try troubleshooting if I were you.That’s what I was telling my wife too normally I never had a problem.I figured I would just wait until later tonight.That makes sense because Timmy failure was originally a bookIf it’s like Netflix you’ll probably still get 4K just a lower bitrate which may be not be noticeable depending on your TV.Basically, they are cutting back to SD quality. But once the crisis is over and everyone is back to their normal daily routine, it should go back to normal quality. [https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/disney-plus-reduce-bandwidth-europe-france-delayed-1203541425/](https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/disney-plus-reduce-bandwidth-europe-france-delayed-1203541425/)It’s HD. They are dropping 4K.offical issue is that eu etc has signed up for a bandwith limit for awhile cous of cv15 so the internet wont be overflooded by the people watching on netflix,viaplay,disney +, hbo, apple plus and more etc. offical reports from tv newsI was hangin\\' out with the EU people on Twitch last night and none of them have even noticed the changes as of yet.  So... no clue.It\\'s unlikely that customers will see a noticeable difference.One source says SD the next says HD and 4K but lower bitrate, at the end of the day it\\'s all BS and doesn\\'t need to happen in the UK atleast as there is enough bandwidth to go around.For just a month, right.>... doesn\\'t need to happen in the UK atleast as there is enough bandwidth to go around. Whether that\\'s true or not, it\\'a only temporary. If they drop quality down to SD, you can still watch. And it will go back to normal when this is all done and people are back to their normal routine.Or however long it takes people to go back to work.HD is reasonable SD isn\\'t.[deleted]And why is that? Do you refuse to watch anything that is not HD? What about old movies that there are no other format available? You just going to refuse to watch it because it\\'s not HD?Does the service state that they\\'ll give you a certain resolution? On Sunday they released Frozen II in HD, but you had to wait to get it in 4K.  As no one was promised anything, I\\'m not sure how you could complain. What\\'s available is what\\'s available.Movies from 1934 all the way up to today have a minimum quality of HD, it does not take as much bandwidth as they\\'re hyping up to stream HD if it\\'s in the right codec and is compressed reasonably. The idea that they will be dropping to SD is BS they won\\'t do it 😂 we don\\'t live in the 90s anymore, HD is widely accessible and any content made on printed film can be make available in HD or 4k so your argument doesn\\'t hold up.[deleted]This is the **Disney+** thread. How am I possibly supposed to know that you\\'re talking about Netflix?!?A new live action Young Indiana Jones series.I need more Muppets!!!Mickey and Minnie\\'s origin story. How he grew up in 8-mile living in a trailer park. Mom wasn\\'t too dependable so he was forced to grow up fast. Meanwhile Minnie is living a similar struggle doing everything she got to do to get accepted into college and earn a scholarship. One day Mickey gets caught driving a roadster racer without a license and has to do community service hours as punishment at a food shelter. The same shelter Minnie is volunteering at. This is when they meet for the first time........this is their storyTron SeriesPirates of the Caribbean series revolving around new characters.A Matt Groening animated seriesMiles Morales series (if Sony allows it)rebooted Marvel Animated SeriesAnakin and Obi-Wan show set between The Phantom Menace and Attack of the ClonesQui-Gon seriesHulk seriesDarth Vader show set between Revenge of the Sith and Star Wars RebelsDarth Sidious seriesSpider-Man miniseries showing his origin (if Sony allows it) (should be 6 episodes at most)New, Henson-quality Muppets!A behind-the-scenes on all the different shows they make. Just make a \"mobile production crew\" for it, find a currently unbusy Disney Face, and interview the Actors, Producers, Directors, Story Boarders and Voice Actors. They have so many shows it could last for seasons easily.MCU backstories on people like Thor\\'s gladiator buddies, pre Agent Carter Howard, Jarvis meeting Ana and the like.But a baby Yoda short series would be cute too.I forgot they own Indiana Jones now. That’d be coolOh yeah, I could easily see the marvel studios subreddit loving the behind the scenes for the Disney plus marvel showsEven the host could change for each: an example teen Cassie for MCU, a voice actor for Disney Junior, a free actor for Star Wars.I could see that maybe being an animated thing with the legosMarvel, Pixar, Lucas Film, Disney Channel. And the can also do shows that are no longer produced as well. They have all the contacts and it doesn\\'t seem to expensive to set up.Lego fits Baby Yoda.That\\'s an awesome surprise! Hope it\\'ll be just as soon for the Netherlands. Shame I didn\\'t get to see it in the cinema, but this makes up for it a bit.I never got to see this in theaters because of the coronavirus. I love Pixar. I’m so excited for this!VOD isn’t a surprise given the number of movies that have done it already, but the quick turnaround to Disney + is very coolIncredibly excited to watch this again and hopefully more people see it.  Was really unlucky with the box officeLet’s hope it will be available in other market like CANADA 🙏🙏While most of the excitement is around the Disney+ release in a couple weeks, I wanna shine a big ol\\' light on the digital download tonight. As far as I can tell, this is not just a super-expensive *rental* like what the other studios are doing. If that were the case, they would\\'ve said VOD in the announcement. No, \"digital download\" implies you can buy this movie and effectively *own* it. Tonight.If the digital download costs no more than $20, Disney just threw the biggest middle finger at its competition. And I\\'m loving it.UPDATE: As of now, the pre-order price on iTunes is still $19.99. Now, that\\'s been the case for weeks since the movie opened in theaters. I\\'m assuming they\\'re not gonna change it with this new release schedule.SECOND UPDATE: Gotta correct myself. With all the recent stories, I must\\'ve skipped some big details. It looks like Universal and Dreamworks are the only studio putting out $20 rentals. Warner Bros, Sony, and now Disney are going the digital download route.This movie has one of my favorite easter eggs. When they go to Burger Shire, the sign says \"Now Serving 2nd Breakfast\"Sucks it didn’t get its full theater run. Seems like a great film, was hoping they would re release it in theaters. Hopefully it makes its money back on Disney +. Very unfortunate timing.Surely an early Disney+ release of Rise of Skywalker has to be next up?Yes!!! So excited. Such a great film.Yay!  We go to the movies a lot, and this was the first movie we would have gone to see in the theater but didn’t.  Glad to get to see it at home.  Yay!I was lucky enough to catch it in IMAX before theatres closed, hope you guys enjoy it because it’s a feels trip all the way.thank god, i wanted to see it in theaters but couldn’t make it first weekend, by the second i was already in quarantineit’s the first (good) pixar movie i missed in theaters since RatatouilleAny idea when it’s out in Canada?It’s a brilliant film. Those that missed it are in for a treat. I’m hoping the same will apply to the other territories, given 3rd April is a couple of weeks after the European launch.While this whole virus thing sucks and I hope it goes away soon, I am happy Disney+ is responding with these surprises. I really wanted to see Onward but decided I would wait and here we are with an early releaseNow give us Rise of Skywalker!\"#PixarOnward is coming to the US tonight on digital download and will be streaming on #DisneyPlus on April 3rd.\"   >publisher: @disneyplus   >links in tweet: https://i.imgur.com/NsGiFPS.jpgThis should become the new norm in the post Covid world. Let’s just put the final nail in the coffin and kill theaters.Available at 5pm PTAwesome! I was bummed I couldn’t go see it because the theaters got shutdown here.Awesome! I didn’t get to see it in theaters but wanted to before they closed down. Looking forward to catching this in two weeks!This could completely change movies.If the coronavirus continues to gets worse and a majority of us are stuck at home, Artemis Fowl is next in MayHow long till it’s in Canada?I’ll wait for 2 weeks. First week of quarantine was shockingly fast. I was just working and binge playing some Assassin’s Creed games.I was so disappointed I couldn’t see it in theaters can’t wait till April 3Wow! That\\'s good news. Was looking forward to seeing it in theaters, then COVID-19 happened, the company that owns my local theater decided to close all it\\'s locations for the time being and now the states shut down. Thank you, Disney+!I want to buy it. I was one of the few who were lucky enough to see it in theaters. It deserves to make more money.Welcome to the new normal.Kind of glad I did my part to watch in theatres while I still could. It\\'s a shame it didn\\'t get a longer run in before everything shut down. Not one of Pixar\\'s best, but the third act was still really cute.I hate I couldn\\'t see it yesterday in theaters, but I\\'m glad I get to watch it now! I heard it is amazing, and I can\\'t wait to see if I love it!I’m so sad that this movie won’t get the box office love it deserves.  It’s a fantastic film.Will the short be there tooOkay, where can I buy the digital of this at? I want to give them the money they deserve. I want to buy it not be restricted to watching it on whatever platform I buy it on like amazon or vudu.Saw it just before we went into isolation in Canada. It is amazing!!! Everyone should see it!It is so good!This is so coolWow! This is an awesome move by the House of Mouse!lets gooo. i got to see it before everything got cancelled but im excited to see it again!Any word on Rise of SkywalkerOkay, but we don\\'t get The Rise of Skywalker early? That movie was in theaters before Onward.Really good movie as well saw it in theaters a few weeks ago.Actually a really good movieAny news about the international disneyplus markets?Can you imagine if this thing happened during a Star Wars release?Hopefully UK too? 😇Yayyyyy! Woke up to a treat! 😊Does this apply for the UK also?Let’s goooooWow this is fantastic. Great to see companies adjust and try to remain accessible.Cool! I am looking forward to watching itI never had to go to the theaters to watch it, yay![removed]Yay! Can\\'t wait!Will it come to Disney Plus UK as well?Awesome. I expected them to do digital downloads, but putting it on Disney+ so soon is completely unexpected and great news.When in Canada?YayThis makes the lack of Maleficent 2 even curiouser... It\\'s been on VOD and Home Media a while... It\\'s their last big title pre December 2019 and they\\'re already onto the 2020 titles.Do it for black widowAnd Mulan???Just bought on Google play store and the family enjoyed it!I hope they do the same for rise of SkywalkerDoes this mean we will get the simpsons short that aired before the movie on dosney plus too now??I really hope they add The Simpsons short that played in front of this to Disney+ too!!!!What the most awf giftYou should have given her credit at leastSo, 2 weeks ago, I bought Frozen 2 and we went to the drive-in to see Onward.  I wouldn\\'t recommend taking stock tips from me.Will Onward be in 4K DV on April 3rd for Disney Plus?I paid $20 for this movie like a week ago.I mean if it’s on digital download they have it.. you know digital. Why isn’t streaming right away?That would be cool, if Disney + would acutally work.Can\\'t connect via wifi on anything. Phone, computer, smart tvs.I\\'m sure it\\'s a good movie but eh. Drop Black Widow on Disney plus day one. Same with New Mutants, just put it out of its misery goshdarnPeople who want to own it would still buy it. But the way I see it I have already paid for it in my subscription and having to wait longer is just going to puss me off. Why piss off the customer you have just so you can maybe pick some others up first?Hope that to!!!The Disneyplusnl Instagram account liked the US announcement post on the Disneyplus account, so I\\'m gonna assume it\\'ll come to the Netherlands soon as well.It\\'s a wonderful movie!I love youActually, I think that\\'s an equally big surprise. Unless they provide further details, it looks like you can actually buy it to *own* tonight. Not just rent.The Disney + is the major surprise. I’d consider renting today but being free in a couple weeks I’m more than happy to wait. They could have tried to make up some of the box office hit with vod for a couple months before Disney +Which movies have done it? I want to see if anything is availableThey are stuck in a hard place (not that I feel remotely bad for them in any way). They have a tight 3 week release schedule. Losing months of release dates either means they have to push other movies around (often out of high value slots) they have hard choices to make about the ones that lost their spots.Gonna be an underrated movie due to covid[removed]Usually when they say US Canada gets lumped inWell, Warner and Sony were first to shift their digital release dates for Birds of Prey and Bloodshot to this coming Tuesday. You’ll be able to purchase them, and in 4K no less!What time is “tonight”?  I told my kids it’s getting released today (my mistake) and they are patiently waiting.Where’s that from again? I remember hearing it before but can’t quite think of the nameI am just hoping that Disney releases it a week before onward and makes a Jojo reference on the post that announces its released.If not, next year will be when its put out.Looks like so far they’re only releasing their animated tiles early on Disney+ and not their live actions like Maleficent 2 and Rise of Skywalker. Only a matter of time before they add those too thoughI would put money on this happening in the next 2-3 weeks.It is a really cute movie! Definitely one for the family.Definitely made me feel alot more than I expected but was really well done imoI took my 6 year old to see it, and she was balling her eyes out. She then told me she never wants to watch it again because its too sad.  SO. MANY. FEELS.Digital Download: Probably the same as the US (but i\\'m not 100% sure)D+: I\\'d say within a week after the american release.Canadian iTunes Store now says March 23, so this coming Monday.I thought they didWait are you from the us?You don\\'t like going to the movies?Any word on price? I\\'m still stunned Disney is not going with the rental strategy like everyone else. Maybe the biggest flex of this crisis yet.\\\\+1. Would love to know as well.It would be hilarious if they include The Simpsons short... in 4:3 aspect ratio.You can buy it on Movies Anywhere and link all your accounts.Nope. Best case Scenario:  Disney shocks up by putting it on Disney + the same day as its Physical release Worst Case Scenario: Next Year. I was reading a slate and was unable to find the movie on it. People were saying July and August, but It didn\\'t appear on either.I actualy hope that they drop it on the 31st (when the physical copy was supposed to come out). If not, Next Year will be it due to the fact its not on the Slate for this year\\'s Disney + release that I have read.Not yet but I doubt it’ll come out for Australia and New Zealand considering it comes out in theatres on Easter Weekend. Which is five days after the Disney+ release. I am seeing it tomorrow in an advanced screening considering I don’t know what Australia’s situation will be like in regards to the Coronavirus.Not a Star Wars release, what if this was one year ago and everyone was waiting for Endgame to come out. Riots in the damn streets.Disney wouldn’t have released it before it grossed 1b.**Please read this entire message**---> Your comment on r/DisneyPlus was removed due to a Rule 2 violation: \"No posts about piracy or VPNs.\" ---**If you believe this post was removed by mistake, please [contact the Moderators.](https://reddit.com/message/compose/?to=r/disneyplus&subject=Question%20About%20A%20Removal)****Violations may result in a temporary or permanent ban.**Looks like it will be available to buy on iTunes on Monday. Not sure about when he will be on Disney+ in Canada.I think its due to a Netflix contract (I heard about this in a reply)Soo, there is apparently a Contract preventing Maleficent from going on Disney + that expires later this year.RipBecause then nobody would buy it.They\\'re adapting the usual release strategy for home video. Digital download now, blu-ray 2 weeks later. Only this time, blu-ray is replaced by streaming.So people who really want to own it buy it first...? It\\'s still a business transaction.Nor in the industy, but streaming takes testing and other resources to make sure it plays correct across tons of connections. Digital releases don\\'t get the abundance of purchases/views that streaming releases see. Film wasn\\'t prepped for release so they\\'re pushing it through to get it to people. Same reason why Frozen 2 HD came out and 4K a few days after that.Black Widow has been delayed.  But New Mutants might as well be a D+ exclusive.nah do you know how terrible that would be in the long run?New mutants yeah they should Black widow is too expensive to put it on the service unfortunately The way I see it though they’ve lost so much from closes stores parks and more that it would just be another loss in the big pile so they might as well release itr/choosingbeggarsI think you answered your own question.Oh no you have to wait a couple more weeks. Look at it this way. You are still getting to see it way way way sooner than you would have before this Covid-19 stuff happened. Under normal circumstances this wouldn’t be our for purchase until June and then on Disney+ in like September/OctoberThey didn’t have to put up up on Disney+ April 3 at all, IMHO they should have a minimum 30 day window between available for digital purchase date and Disney+ release for movies that weren’t intended to be Disney+ originals. I watched it already in theaters so I can wait the couple weeks for the Disney+ release and then once they eventually get around to physical release I’ll still pick up the combo pack to support the film.This movie wasn’t budgeted around Disney+ and it still has to recoup at least some costs.They only \"piss off\" customers who are egregiously entitled and demanding. Meanwhile, Pixar and everyone involved in making this movie appreciates this opportunity to actually earn the revenue their work was robbed of by the crisis.A $6.99 monthly fee (that provides access to an entire library of IP) does not cover the cost of a single $19.99 digital download. Old math, new math, doesn\\'t matter.Because since Onward didn’t release in China due to COVID-19, Disney has to make their money back somehow. The movie lost a lot of money because of the limited release.Happy cake day!Pixar isn’t capable of anything else.I love you bothReally makes you wonder why there\\'s a good 6 months or so after theatrical release for movies to be available via VOD/streaming.Agreed.  I’ll be doing the VOD for Trolls 2 the day it’s available, and would do the same with Onward too if not for the soon D+ release.  I’ll gladly wait two weeks for OnwardEdit: I’ll add this, it technically won’t be free since you need a subscription.  However, if you already have the service like me, then it’s a nice and welcome surpriseSee, I figured I would buy it to support an original Pixar film (as in, not a sequel). We were going to spend $50+ so our family could go see it in theaters before the virus anyway.How ya\\'ll actually advocate for artificialy delayed releases is beyond me.[Here’s a list](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/movies/movies-home-digital-early.html?0p19G=2870)  including Frozen 2 which wasn’t supposed to be on Disney+ for a few months.Actually I have a feeling a ton of people are going to be streaming it if they market this digital release well enoughDefinitely not underrated it got the rating it deserved It just bombed**Please read this entire message**---> Your comment on r/DisneyPlus was removed due to a Rule 2 violation: \"No posts about piracy or VPNs.\" ---**If you believe this post was removed by mistake, please [contact the Moderators.](https://reddit.com/message/compose/?to=r/disneyplus&subject=Question%20About%20A%20Removal)****Violations may result in a temporary or permanent ban.**Oh really? I don\\'t know how I missed that. Disney still has the winning hand with the streaming announcement, but I gotta give it to WB and Sony for getting brand new releases to the digital download market first.Okay then, it\\'s just Universal that looks like the greedy fool now.What’s shocks me is that Disney isn’t charging a premium on the 4K version of Onward, same price as HD day one. Hopefully this starts the new trend of all 4Ks being priced same as HD like all the other studios. A stretch, but now a possibility. Especially since their older 4Ks sometimes go on sale for $19.99 now too anyway. At the very least offer 4K on iTunes.Will they be doing physical releases any time soon?  I’m assuming they haven’t been manufactured yet, and with everything going in their distribution centers and all that probably aren’t operating.5pm Pacific. That info was already provided in the press release, and earlier in this very thread.Lord of the RingsMaybe, but I could see them holding off until after Clone Wars is over.Yeah, typically all digital purchases are same date, I didn’t see any posts from Disney Canada about it though.YesThey gave us the digital download a few days early, but no mention of it being added to Disney+ yet. Even though Frozen 2 and now Onwards are being added to Disney+ so early.No mention of Maleficent 2 either despite that coming out even before Frozen 2. Looks like only the animated features are being released early, and not the live actions.Nope.$19.99YeaWill Movies Anywhere allow me to download it to an Hard Drive? Worried about losing the internet and would like to have an offline option.Ok, but it came out in the Netherlands 2 days before the US. I\\'ll just wait and see. Obviously not the most important thing right now.New Mutants might be considered a Fox acquisition which means it has to go elsewhere first.Probably his first streaming service. Kids today...right?Very true! I cried like a baby during this movie (as is customary with Pixar movies). I wanted to watch it again, so Im happy it\\'s being released on Disney+ so soon.I thought it was pure garbage. Me and my friend had both booked premiere tickets and left the cinema thoroughly disappointed. We are both huge fans of Disney and Pixar and had been looking forward to this for ages.It was just bad and uninspired.They do that so people will watch in theatres, getting them the best return on investment. This is a desperate move to make back a couple of bucks. If it\\'s unbelievably successful the industry might change forever. If it isn\\'t, things will probably remain as they are now for much longer than they otherwise would.  I just watched it and it was great!I’m not advocating. I’m pleasantly surprised.Thanks for the list, palIt’s not in the same tier as UP or WALL-E but it was a solid movie. Underrated in the sense that so few people were able to see it in theatres before everything shut down. Underviewed may be a better termIt bombed because no one wanted to go to a crowded theater with the fear.  It’s not your typical bomb.Lol don’t know why you were downvoted. Bombing in the box office due to a pandemic =/= underrated.Didnt do really good the second weekend? And then...covidBombed? The theaters are closed lol.Yeah. The Gentlemen also shifted to a release this Tuesday (at least I think it shifted, that movie did release theatrically a while ago), and in Canada they dropped the price to $14.99, which is $10 cheaper than most new releases!It’s Comcast. What were you expecting?Wait, same price as HD? You mean on Vudu? (I’m in Canada so all I have is iTunes.)Gosh I hope this means they bring 4K content to iTunes. It’s weird that they held off for so long because they (reportedly) refused to not charge more for 4K content, and then Disney+ comes along and they offer 4K for the same price as SD and HD, unlike their biggest competitor.With all the 4K HDR & Atmos content on Disney+, it doesn’t make sense to me that they’d continue to refuse to make those available on iTunes.Thank you.I really don’t know about that cause Frozen 2 is a big deal and Onward is releasing the same day as a CW episodeCanadian iTunes Store now says March 23, so this coming Monday.[deleted]How come? Apparently others agree. I love the movies lolAgain, WOW.Universal and the other studios *need* to reevaluate their $20 rentals coming next week. This is not gonna look good for them.I’m fine w that.  Going to the theaters, paying for 4 tickets, parking, the obligatory popcorn is usually above $50.   This is a saving.  We are prepping the living room for a “movie night”.   Thanks Disney.Yes. You can also download it on whichever service you prefer. All of my digital purchases/downlode codes are redeemed through Movies Anywhere, but I prefer to download them through the Apple TV (iTunes) app on my phone. I just prefer that player much more.I’d say you guys would be different. Each territory would be. UK will probably get it when it launches there.Sorry, I guess I read your \"could have\" as \"should have.\"That list has six movies that are not Disney.>It’s not in the same tier as UP or WALL-E but it was a solid movie.I\\'d go so far as to say that Pixar movies are like pizza--there aren\\'t any bad ones, but when you get a real legit one, it knocks your socks off.Didn’t say it was bad. I loved it. Y’all just wanted a reason to downvote me.Yeah I loved the movie Too bad idiot Disney fanboys got butthurtWell yeah it bombed because of that...Yes....the sales are still the sales though. This pandemic completely messed up the numbers. It’s going to be released for rental waaaaaaaaay sooner than expected because it bombed in theater ticket sales and they’re trying to recoup as much and as quickly as possible.If it did shift, couldn\\'t have been more than a few weeks early. It had already left my local cinemas weeks before the shutdown.Yes Vudu shows all 3 resolutions (SD, HDX, UHD) as $19.99 for purchase.So far iTunes still shows HD only but that’s not surprising as they haven’t made the change to allow 4K on iTunes. Yes that’s what I thought too, they’re allowing 4K on their $6.99/mo service but won’t let people buy them for $19.99 each?True, but Clone Wars and Rise of Skywalker are both Star Wars things.I’m talking about the sequel. Not the original. The original came out in 2014 and is under contract elsewhere until October of this year. But the sequel came out last year after Disney+ launched.All movies from 2019 onwards have no contract anywhere else because Disney knew they’d have their own streaming service so no need to pass their movies along to Netflix or Starz or any other services, when they can just put it on their own service and make the streaming revenue directly. The sequel came out in October of last year, and is speculated to be released on Disney+ sometime in may since all their 2019 releases have been added roughly 6-7 months after their theatrical release.However Frozen 2 which was released a month after Maleficent 2, in November 2019, and slated to be on Disney+ this June, was moved up and added this month after only a month of being available on home media.And now Onward is being added after just a few weeks of its theatrical release. Yet Maleficent 2 nor Rise of Skywalker which were released before or between those movies, have not been announced to be added onto Disney+ at all.Not next week, today. Universal’s rentals are already up, with banners for all three on iTunes.Awesome thank you for that information!Yeah I edited it. Sorry lolIt\\'s of my opinion that any pizza with pineapple on it is a bad one, thankfully Pixar don\\'t make movies with pineapple on top.Maybe if you weren\\'t so rude about it you wouldn\\'t be getting downvoted.You\\'re allowed your opinion, just be more respectful of others\\' opinions.Maleficent and Maleficent 2 fall under a contract that expires later this year preventing them from going on Disney +. You should have figured this includes the sequel. That is what I heard.Ah. I was thinking of rentals (from other studios) still coming on 3/24, like Birds of Prey and Bloodshot. Forgot Universal was releasing theirs earlier.Just to add to the reply; if you buy the movies on Movies Anywhere, you can watch them on your Xbox, PC, and also Xfinity allows you to link your account so you can watch them on your cable box if that\\'s an option.Pinapple on pizza is amazingThey made brave.Rude about what? I liked the movie. I’m assuming people who liked it too downvoted me because they can’t understand simple comments.Oscar winning films bomb a lot of the time. Just because it doesn’t make money doesn’t make it bad.Birds of Prey and Bloodshot are going to be purchases, not rentals. At least they show as preorders on iTunes.Brave is goodAh, I see what you mean now.The way you phrased it made it seem like you were saying it was a bad movie.Sorry about the misunderstanding.Yeah, I\\'m making addendums all over the place.Already made this update (second update) on my OP.I hate brave. It\\'s one of the least enjoy able films I\\'ve ever seenAlso on RT it has 87% Critic and 95% audience That’s insanely high compared to the rest of the films this yearOh, didn’t realize you were the same person, sorry!Why are you getting downvoted for your opinion? I also agree I did not like that movie at all. Cars 2 is far worse thoughDo you want to watch Disney+ content or Amazon Prime\\'s content? You\\'re the only who can tell what you\\'ll enjoy more. Also, you can always sign up for one, cancel, sign up for the other and switch whenever you feel like it.Disney+ is exactly what its advertised to be. Disney animation, Pixar, Marvel, and star wars. If you don\\'t care about these things and you\\'re looking for more than that, you\\'re better off elsewhere.You can download the apps and browse their libraries to see which one has more of the content you prefer.You can also get free trials of both and then cancel the one that doesn’t interest you as much.Amazon will have more varied content like Netflix and cost a few dollars more.Disney is all Disney content, some fox, but mostly family friendly only stuff, no mature content.So it really depends on what kind of content you prefer to watch.Disney is oriented more towards families with young kids, where as Netflix and Prime are catch alls for everyone, as they license content from several different studios alongside their own originals.It depends on what kind of content you are interested in. Disney Plus has Star Wars, Marvel, Pixar, Disney and Nat Geo. Amazon has many shows from the networks and syndication (ex: House MD, Psyche, X-Files, Monk, Parks and Rec, Downton Abbey, The Cosby Show), plus movies. Their original content is great too, with series like Hunters, Man in the High Castle, Hanna, The Boys, Jack Ryan, etc. Prime membership also includes the free shipping (that is worth it after just a few purchases), access to Prime Day sales (like Black Friday, but in the summer), free streaming music, e-books, and other content.Both have trials I think. If you were interested in movies I’d go with HBO unless you want to watch some pg Disney stuff, Star Wars and marvel.You look like a chomo so I think you’ll like Disney plus betterI have Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, and Disney+. Disney is great, if you like the content they have, but it is also very limited in scope. Amazon prime is the service I use the most.Right now, Prime easy.Depends how many extra subscriptions you want to pay for with Amazon. Like Starz, Shudder, Stacks TV etc...Why not both? I have Netflix, Prime, and D+. All three are very different. Netflix has a lot of more mature original content than the others while D+ has more family friendly content. And Prime I don\\'t even consider part of the mix since I don\\'t watch very much video content on it.I\\'d get Prime because then you can get ebooks and music (and other things?). A lot of people don\\'t buy on Amazon *because of shipping costs,* now that it\\'s free, I buy a lot of $1 and $5 things that I\\'d never have bought on-line before. Plus, if you\\'re locked down with Covid-19, free shipping might be handy...That said, there isn\\'t any reason to not have Disney+ for a month, then Prime, then HBO, then Hulu and then start the process over again. Besides, they all offer a trial, so if you don\\'t like it, then you can cancel it.I have all of them. We literally never use prime. I’d go with Disney +.Prime is good if you want a lot of varied content, free one day delivery on amazon, free music like spotify, free ebooks and free twitch prime. But as many others have said, if you are only interested in disney then you may as well get disney plus. P.s. it is not difficult to work out what is on prime and what isnt.One has The Mandalorian and the other doesn’t...Yes.I will say the layout of prime video is absolutely awful. Haven\\'t watched much on it, my family mainly uses it for free shippingI was mainly trying to get opinions from people who had both of those services and let me know what they think of each service and which one gives you the most enjoyment for your money.I am into Disney content but I just want what will give me the most value for my money.I don\\'t usually like mature content as much. At times there are a lot of things on disney plus that sound really cool and I have wanted to watch. If I want to watch non Disney content I have Netflix for that. I don\\'t care about the free shipping so that does not factor into my decision of getting prime vs Disney plus.I don\\'t want HBO. I am neutral about Disney content as I\\'m neither for or against it but it sounds like that I might enjoy Disney\\'s plus original content more than what\\'s on prime.I\\'m not the one paying for it my mom is. She said I can get either one of these two. I don\\'t need all three of them especially since I have so many movies in my Netflix list that I haven\\'t watched yet.>I\\'d get Prime because then you can get ebooks and music (and other things?).Yup. And the free shipping as you stated also. I hardly watch any video on Amazon.This is the way.I\\'m into movies more than tv shows but I would check it out if I got Disney plus.That would make me vote for Amazon.I just think it might be hard to tell what\\'s free and what isn\\'t free on prime.I have prime because of the shipping benefits, not because I get to watch Mrs. Maisel.No one can answer that question for you. It’s completely subjective to the user and what they like to watch.Then it sounds like Disney+ is your better bet. Though you can always get a free trial of Amazon too to see if you are interested in any of their content too in case you don’t find enough to watch on Disney after the few movies and shows you want to check out.Disney Pluses original content worth watching as of now is The Mandalorian, nothing else..>I\\'m not the one paying for it my mom is.That was missing form your original post. If you can only have one, go with D+. As I stated, I don\\'t use Amazon Prime very much fro video, but mostly for the other features (ebooks, free 2 day shipping, music service, etc.). I also have Hulu, which I use for live TV.Well then you have all of Star Wars, Marvel, Pixar and all of that regarding film series on Disney+Not that Amazon doesn’t have a good selection though.The shipping benefits are not that important to me as I don\\'t buy from Amazon a lot.I had a trial of prime and I only used it once but there were a couple of things out there I wanted to watch on prime but I don\\'t think that would be enough of a reason to get prime. I\\'m afraid I would spend too much time browsing on prime and not find anything I feel like watching. I\\'m sure I would do that on Disney plus too but it seems like it would be easier to find something to watch on there more likely then I would  with prime.I already ended up choosing to get Disney plus as it may be less content but the it might be better quality. With prime I only saw a handful of popular movies that I wanted to see that aren\\'t on netflix. I\\'m glad I chose Disney plus.That\\'s because you have to pay for shipping. Once it\\'s free, you might use it!Are you in lockdown because of the pandemic?At the moment, it\\'s a bit of a gamble. Disney Plus doesn\\'t have unified content yet, so versions and availability vary per region.It would be much appreciated if someone set up a site to keep track of the 50 most popular titles and the their respective languages...You should get good returns looking at: * Disney Channel / Disney XD Shows - Cartoons or live action* Disney Channel Original Movies* \"Disney+ Originals\"* MCU shows* The Simpsons (with 19 seasons of cropped aspect ratio...)   * Offers Quebec\\'s and Paris\\' French - the duel between the dubs is famous actually! Be warned there is no guarantee on *which* kind of French you get (I\\'m a pure Anglophile so I can\\'t tell the difference unless it tells me)As a heads up on Frozen II at least, the put it up 3 months early, when it first came up, it was only English at all. I expect it (and Onward) were a bit of a rush order due to....Awesome, thank you for the thoughtful response!! Ill have to check out the Simpsons differences, it sounds funny :)Nothing so far. It\\'s releasing soon in French and Germany, but not in Belgium, so maybe they could release it at the same time than Belgium.(This is a theory)Request a title hereActually, there’s a few other Pixar titles (such as TV specials and shorts) missing with unknown D+ release dates:-Toy Story of Terror!-Toy Story That Time Forgot-Marine Life Interviews-Miss Fritter’s Racing SkooolBut I agree, this and the above 4 really need to be added soon.I loved this show. I want it on Disney+ too.Will do!I think the Toy Story ones are on Now TV so that might be why.Is Germany big on credit cards?I\\'m from the Netherlands and a lot of people don\\'t have one or never use a credit card. You can subscribe to Disney+ with other payment methods here like iDeal and PayPal.Don\\'t use any payment methods other than those registered in the country where you live, unless using PayPal. Disney Plus can and will block access if they suspect fraud, and with credit cards that is highly likely.There will be enough payment methods available, otherwise subscribe through iTunes.PayPal it is then, thanksThere are some lightning to hdmi adapters that don’t support stuff like Netflix Hulu or Disney+ because they don’t have the rights to allow it to be streamed. I ran into this same problem a few months ago and had to learn this unfortunately. With me, the sound of the content would play fine but the screen would be black.One of my TVs is a 55’ 2007 Sony WEGA with a single HDMI input. The cheapest and easiest solution was to get an Amazon Firestick for $30 (pre Holiday price... I think it’s $40 now). Streams Disney+, Netflix, Amazon, YouTube, AppleTV+, and a ton more. Since you have an IPhone, I’m assuming you might have an iTunes library? The Firestick can stream your entire library through the AppleTV+ app on the Firestick.I would recommend looking into a device like a Roku (I recommend an Ultra) or a Chromecast. Some services don\\'t allow the transmission of media through a cable.See if you\\'re plugging it into a mhl port on the tv. Thanks for not telling us what the error message says...Wheree is American Dragon: Jake Long?

Unfortunately a tent pole comic book movie would lose way too much for Disney to release it to Disney Plus instead of a theatrical release.$7 for an entire household to view repeatedly vs $12 per person for one viewing. I don’t see it happening. They could go the VOD route like other recent films, charging $20 or more for a 48-hour viewing window. Probably twice that amount. If Disney decides to release any movie direct to VOD or D+, it will probably be Fox’s New Mutants which has now been delayed at least 3 times. With most TV and movie production shut down, many scheduled release dates will have to be pushed-back. Black Widow is exactly the type of movie theaters need to draw business when things begin to re-open.I respectfully disagree.  Many of us want to see the movie in theaters for the first time.  Not releasing it in theaters at all would not only make them lose a ton of money,  but ruin the experience for movie goers like myself that never miss a single marvel movie in theaters.  It’s a different,  much better experience to view the movie.  I’d rather wait longer,  than watch it on a smaller screen,  with smaller sound.> **they should add a suggestion or discussion flair** This is not a Disney supported subreddit. It\\'s fan-run. You can make suggestions here, but it\\'s only going to be heard by other fans, and not likely heard by Disney themselves.And no, I disagree with you. I want to see it on the big screen, not the tiny screen. I\\'m very happy they are delaying it so I can see it the way it was made to be seen. I can wait. I have thousands and thousands of other movies available to watch while I wait, so I\\'m not impatient about it.I get you’re excited for BW, but Disney’s already lost and continues to lose a ton of revenue for everyday that their theme parks are shut down and movie theatres are closed globally. They can’t just give you the rest of 2020’s movie slate on D+ because you want it. They’d be hard pressed to make that money back that way, so for the good of the company as a whole, it’s best that they chose to delay things. They’re giving us what they can (Frozen II, Onward) at their own expense, so please just try to be grateful.welp that\\'s bad but I understand why they did itwelp, I see what you are seeing at. but like you said they should charge people to watch it in disney+ because it\\'s very early to be in a subscription service, but it would be way better than just delaying it.Yeah ik it’s run by fans but they should add a discussion flairThey could, but by the time they got the infrastructure in place to do so, the crisis will be over and movie theaters will be open again.Remember when D+ first started up in Nov? All the problems they had because they infrastructure couldn\\'t handle the load of so many people? It will be the same thing if they just throw it on what they have now. They need to invest in more, set it up, test it out, really test it out, test it out with a even larger load, retest with the larger load, and then release it gradually to locations. You\\'re looking at a year or two before that\\'s done.Yeah maybe technology can’t handle that. Just wanted to watch black widow on its actual release date not a delayed date. Guess I’m in a rush I’m really excited but now bummed cuz they delayed it.Standard release schedule would be June / July. No idea if it could be bumped up.I HATE DISNEY PLUSHappened to me ,don\\'t know why tho . Same exact issueI\\'ve been having that issue whenever an episode starts. If I have been binge watching a show. It\\'s been happening for over a month now.Same situation here, following for solution.If they were originally recorded on video tape then they will always have a low quality. If they were originally recorded on film and the film still exists then a 4k scan or higher could be made.Director of The Luck of The Irish, Jump In, and several other DCOMs, came on the The Relunchables, podcast and discussed this very question. Can you watch YouTube via your Blu-Ray player? I can access Netflix through my Blu-Ray player (it’s also “smart” but my TV is not. The player came preloaded with Netflix). I’m asking because I’ve only ever heard someone say “cast” when they have a third-party device like a Firestick or a Chromecast. I have the latter to watch Disney+ but it works perfectly and was well worth the $30.Buy a Roku. You can load the app on it, and you don\\'t have to cast anything to it to watch. plus, you can get them pretty inexpensively - They have a few models that are under $50.If you can afford a roku then I’d definitely invest in that. You go an get them fairly cheapBuy a chromecast.Just fork out $30 for a Roku and you’ll be happy for life. More apps than any other streaming box. Just go for it.I\\'m having a similar issue on my Samsung Galaxy S8. I have the Disney+ app on my phone but there is no cast icon which should be in the top right of the screen, I also have the app on a Samsung Tablet and same issue... no cast icon so I cannot stream to my smart tvs...Any ideas as the Disney helpdesk had no clue???TIAI have the option of YouTube, playstation video, or Netflix plus a bunch of random services that I\\'ve never heard of on my blu ray. I have a cast button on, YouTube that puts it on my tv. I\\'m good at the basics of modern tech so forgive me if I\\'m being confusing. It\\'s a rectangular icon and one of the corners is a diagonal WiFi symbol, lol. I push that on my phone and YouTube appears on my tv. I can\\'t find the symbol on Disney+ but google says it\\'s possible to cast it. I assumed since I could do it on YouTube that I could do it with Disney+.Curious as to why you would recommend a Chromecast over a Roku or Firestick. Obviously price is a factor when comparing AppleTV, but Roku and Firestick cost about the same as Chromecast, don’t rely on a phone, have remotes for easier navigation and don’t have the same stuttering/interruption issues that come with the extra step required for casting to a TV.Sorry there\\'s a random comma in there and I\\'m not sure how to edit it lolYou need to have the Disney Plus app on your blu ray player in order to cast it.  You may have to add it yourself, that is if it\\'s a supported device.I know what you mean (I think!) :). All these options are courtesy of your Blu-Ray player, correct? Do you know if you can update it to include D+? If you can’t add new services to the ones on your player, you could try casting it from your laptop to your TV because that option is readily available and free. When I got Disney+ I scoured the help section and could not find anything about smart Blu-Ray players... the service seems to be tailored to smart TVs, not their home media counterparts :(. I could be wrong and just in case, contact customer service— but short of budgeting for a new TV, you have the option to purchase a Roku, a Firestick, Chromecast or Apple TV. I really hope you’re able to figure this out :)!I recommend against using your phone to “cast” to your TV. One of my TVs is an old Sony WEGA from 2007 with a single HDMI port. I had a 2nd generation AppleTV connected but since their was no Disney+ app on the earlier AppleTV generations, I would “cast” from the IPhone to the Apple TV. Too many interruptions caused by various reasons that would cause the cast to lose connection and the quality of casting is inferior to the streaming devices that plug directly into the TV.I didn’t want to purchase another AppleTV as I recently bought the 4th generation 4K for another TV, so opted for a significantly cheaper Amazon Firestick that cost $30 instead of $180 this past holiday season. It plugs into the lone HDMI port and streams Disney+, Netflix, YouTube, AppleTV+ and a bunch of other services as well. It streams flawlessly compared to trying to “cast/airplay” from a phone. Save yourself a ton of headaches and choose a device that plugs directly into your TV especially since he 1080P versions of Firestick and Roku are the same cost as Chromecast. If you are willing to spend more, the AppleTV IMHO is the best streaming device available. The Firestick and AppleTV both get the job done well, but the AppleTV does it in style. If you have an iTunes library it’s a no brainer and you will get a full years subscription to Apple TV+ for free ($60 value).OP asked how to cast to a TV. Those other devices work differently.Thanks. I don\\'t think it is :(Okay I\\'m sorry again for the dumb question, but what are those? Like if I get a chromecast, is it a media box I plug into my tv? I have some kinda of android box right now that belongs to my roommate but when I went on the play store on it, it didn\\'t have the option of disney+...I\\'m more of an android person, but thank you for the firestick vs chromecast thoughts!Don’t apologize, it’s not a dumb question at all :). A Chromecast is a device you can plug into your TV. You download the app on your phone, set it up (it walks you through the installation process, easy peasy) and you would then download Disney+ and whatever other apps you want on your phone. From inside the D+ app (and again, on the computer as well) you can cast your program of choice to the TV.  I was considering getting a smart TV but the Chromecast was the better option for me at the time. Other people prefer a Firestick (Amazon) a Roku or a Chromecast. They basically all do the same things, but Apple TV plays well with Apple products (it’s also more expensive) and the Chromecast can work with Google Play. I hope that helps :).ETA: changed some words for clarificationThanks! One last question... If I\\'m casting to a chromecast or Roku or whatever, can I still use my phone? Does the cast run in the background or is it like YouTube and stops when you minimize it?I can only speak on the Chromecast and yes, you can totally still use your phone and other apps on it while watching D+. Nobody will see what you’re doing, it only casts the selected programming :). When the movie or show finishes on your TV, it just goes to a blue screen with the D+ logo on it until you play something else.Biggest drawback to Chromecast is the fact that it relys on your phone. Phone calls are a hassle and the lack of a remote control makes navigating inconvenient. Quality is iffy with stuttering/interruptions the biggest complaints. Roku or Firestick plug directly into your TV. That’s it. No need for a middle man so to speak. Both have remotes which makes user interface much easier.Thank you so much!! You\\'ve been really helpfulYou’re welcome :)! I forgot to mention: I can still make and receive calls while using the CC, no problem. It doesn’t cause any lag and is actually smoother/faster than Netflix. On the other end of the spectrum, my family member has a Firestick and loves it :). It all depends on what works best for you— I hope you find something :).Likely, yes.Thank youDefinitely. The countdown on their website currently says 3 and a half hoursMost likely your ad blocker is blocking you. Disable it or find a way to exclude Disney Plus.There was another thread about it. Mine is working on one TV that has  a Roku, it\\'s not working on the Fire StickThey seemed to force a global logout the other day. If you can log out, try that. If not, delete or uninstall Disney+ app, reboot device, then install from scratch.Turn off the device you are streaming on and unplug your wifi modem for about 30 secs then plug it back in. Restart everything. Usually corrects the problem.Was watching dark wing duck on my phone and it was playing fineI would recommend you call customer support. You can find their number on their web site under \"Help\".Mines goodContact support.I never got logged out. Where did you hear that from?Sorry, i heard more than a few reports of being logged out, sounded like it was a bunch of folksHad a similar issue on a fire stick. Uninstalled and reinstalled and it\\'s fixedZales Jewelry. They had a promotional campaign with the film\\'s release and they must have used some of the actual pieces in the film. That\\'s the only company I see under *\"Thanks to\"* in the closing credits.Does there have to be something?We watched it as well.   It was on the listing when starting the movie but could not find anything.Disney is selling actual flying carpets now! ;)So you\\'re saying I can purchase those sick genie bracelets at Zales? Brb.Considering that it’s listed in the opening by Disney, yeah probably. I can’t imagine them saying it’s there just to mess with people, though that would be a great troll.It\\'s an older UK service being discontinued and replaced with +Two different things.Ok thanks, so If I cancel my Disney life sub, which I accidentally took out, my Disney plus would still be active on the £49.99 preorder plan?Do you happen to know what the app is called? I have an Apple TV 4K so hoping there’s an app for it on release day.Contact Disney Plus Help for account issues.The old service/app is Disney Life. The new one is Disney+.Guessing it will only be available on the release day?Maybe.aving the same problems right now. Do you get an error message at all?Watching now on my fire stick with no issues (US).It hasn\\'t worked on either my fire TV or my separate firestick for 3 days now (US)It just died a few minutes ago on my Shield TV boxes. Doesn’t work on my iPhone either.what error code do you have? trying disney plus on apple tv and iphone gives me error code 83Been streaming since 10am straight. No issues.Can’t get it to work on my fire tvI have been trying for the past 3 hours to get it launch on my Fire Stick and can\\'t. Keep getting Can’t connect for Disney+ right now. Try again later.It\\'s working fine on my Roku.Not working on my roku.I’m on a Verizon iPhone and an iPad connected to my home WiFi and neither will let me log into Disney+. Keep getting the spinning blue ball of death or the “something went wrong” message. Geez, Disney.It\\'s not working on my shield tvs or android phones.I posted near the same post a few days ago. Someone suggested tech support. They had me factory restore stick among other useless procedures and it did nothing.I have Firetv, firestick and Kindle Fires and none of them work with D+Our iPhones and AppleTv play it fine.It’s not working on my Firestick either. Working on my iPhone. I’ve deleted and reinstalled the app as well as a factory reset and still not workingWell before it was saying something like :”Can’t connect for Disney+ right now. Try again later.” But I deleted the app and redownloaded and now it’s on a loading screen that just says Disney+That’s weird I’m in the US too. Maybe it’s a regional thing? I don’t think it’s my WiFi because all my other apps are working fineOk glad to know I’m not the only one! It must have something to do with the amount of people stuck at homeGood to know since I was considering doing that. Literally all the TVs in my house have Fire sticks so I guess I’ll just have to resort to watching on my phone instead of my 49” TV in my bedroom😞Mine is up and working again, I had that same error screen, I hope yours gets up soonStill down 😕I\\'d prefer just a show, personally.The way the books were structured feels like an 8-12 episode season structure would be ideal. Preferably with shorter episodes akin to The Mandalorian\\'s.Would definitely love to see that!I would totally watch the hell out of that.Yes! With a better director!No, but they should make it an animated TV series.I think they should make it a television series. Similar to the way that Netflix did an adaptation of A Series of Unfortunate Events and Locke and Key.I honestly think the first couple books can probably be done in 4 episodes each. They’re pretty short and there’s no need to needlessly add in a bunch of filler just to extend them. The others I can see being about 8 eps thoughSuggest it hereYeah I didThank you broHow do you do it?Yo, did you suggest it?Select the Feedback option. Then from the drop down, select suggest a title. You can add three at a time. You can also suggest site updates, to make the site layout better.If you’ve been able to pay for the service, I would imagine you’ll be able to make use of it come 24/03/20.I just logged into my account and I got the whole ‘not available in this region’ message.https://imgur.com/a/CKA5f2hI’m making the assumption come launch day we will both have full access.Tried to sign up this morning and says service not available in my region (Isle of Man). Hope they sort this soon.Mine is different. I can’t even log into my account on the Isle of Man.I’d say check in with there support team then ma dude https://help.disneyplus.com/cspCan’t access that without that 3 letter ban. But when I HAVE been able to access it, they’ve assured me that it will be available.  So I guess I’ll have to wait and see.I came here to whine about this. Why tf am I subscribed to Disney + if Apple is asking me to pay for the movie and Disney + doesn’t even have it yet?Because releasing movies on subscription services that early is usually bad for businessIf movies release on Disney+ at the same time as DVD and digital nobody would buy them on DVD and digitalYes but it can be viewed in America with Disney Plus apparently.What? That is completely untrueThis is not true. We don’t expect it on Disney+ for at least 3 months.Unfortunately I believe it is currently on starzThey don\\'t want a better Robert Downey Jr movie than the MCU movies on their platform.because it\\'s pure nightmare fuel and nobody ever wants to see it again(the real reason (i think) is because it may have had some issues and disney is fixing it)Because those eyes are terrifyingGreatness must be containedIt will be on Disney+ on April 3rd. I’d just wait two weeksWasting money at a time like this? ***NO***, not torn at all. I can wait 2 weeks...Disney is running a real loss on Disney+. Yes it’s a company with a lot of money, but their largest revenue producers - parks and movies - are shut down. It feel kind of stupid saying this about a company with so much money, but they won’t keep making things we love if they’re not making a profit.My dilemma lies in waiting for the blu-ray. I\\'ve always waited the extra 2 weeks for the physical release, especially since that includes a digital download code. But will I still want to buy the blu-ray after it\\'s been on Disney+ for weeks? We\\'ll see.If you want to watch it I have it on my Plex server.NoI missed it in theaters, I was ready to wait 3 months to be able to see it - two weeks and $20 saved. I can easily wait!Just wait it’s coming out around the start of April I think don’t waste your money[deleted]Definitely just wait.  Plenty of other things to watch in the meantime.  If you decide that you really want to own it later on, that\\'s still an option for you.Yeah. Because I saw it in theaters last Friday and tbh, I wasn’t that impressed. So do I want to spend money on it when I can just watch it on Disney plus? I don’t know.Just wait. It’s not a good movie.I\\'m not worried. All this is just going to be a giant tax write-off for them. Plus, their really big blockbuster films, like *Black Widow*, they are holding back on waiting for the theaters to reopen so they can really rake in the money from them. After all this is over, people are going to want to go out, and one place they will be going is the movies. Opening weekend for a lot of films the first few weeks after the theaters open again will be HUGE.I really want to know their decision on this. Disney is largely targeted for any little thing they do.For example, this move is huge but people are now steamrolling them with what about Rise of Skywalker. Frozen 2 they bumped up way ahead of their targeted schedule and this being a 2 week difference between buying or using their service is a bit interesting.According to [this article](https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/06/01/how-the-walt-disney-company-makes-most-of-its-mone.aspx), parks and movies are Disney\\'s 2nd and 3rd largest revenue streams, respectively.  Their largest income source is still their networks.  ESPN (which admittedly is probably down in viewership at the moment), ABC, Disney Channel(s), Hulu, and now Disney+.  Overall, I doubt that those numbers are affected too significantly right now.Parks basically aren\\'t making any money right now, so yes, that\\'s definitely a hit.For movies, yeah, they\\'re missing out on some box office revenue right now.  But they\\'re still making money on home media (DVD/Blu-Ray/Digital) purchases and rentals.  And the movies that were going to be released during the closure will still be released, just later.  Production on movies and shows have been suspended, but I\\'m sure there\\'s still progress that will be made during this shutdown for preproduction and postproduction work.  Which likely means that once production resumes, we\\'ll have more concurrent projects than originally planned and a more accelerated release schedule over the next couple of years as we get everything \"caught up\".&#x200B;Overall, I\\'m not worried.  Disney can afford to weather this storm, and they\\'re not going to start making less content just because they had a down year just like the rest of the world.Not saying the studios and the parks aren’t profitable, but isn’t the TV division their largest revenue stream?You can’t rent it. It’s $19.99 for purchase only.Both movies did very well at the box office. But they can\\'t be throwing everything onto D+ early because of the crisis. They are putting some stuff out there early, and releasing other stuff digitally and on disc early. But some stuff they will be holding back so they don\\'t lose too much.They are all available for download!I still have issues starting playback when not on WiFi, is that just me?Really sort of kills the point of downloadsYeah, there\\'s issues with watching offline. You\\'ll encounter the spinning blue circle, error 83 (from what I\\'ve found while googling, this means either a failed DRM check or couldn\\'t contact the servers) and error 42 (no internet connection). These errors really bug me since the point of downloading is to watch offline. Of course you won\\'t be able to connect to the servers to perform a DRM check. I hope Disney fixes this soon, or I\\'m going to leave.I don’t have any!They\\'ve just got to do the same thing as moviesanywhere, that\\'s another Disney owned service and offline playback works perfectly wellI mean cant you just play all the movies in order? Or at least the ones that are available?I wish it was set up in a resumable playlist!Eventually, they will. But they still don’t have the rights to stream them allThere’s a fan edit that does that. It’s an interesting way to watch it.I Wish Disney+ would release middle east i think that it will be a great chance for other people to see how Disney+ works and how it is more better than all of the streams (NO OFFENSE)Am what Disney + will be available in App Store in my country call qatarMarvel through the years? But it’s not one videoI\\'ve been working through [CNET\\'s](https://www.cnet.com/features/watch-every-marvel-movie-and-tv-show-in-the-perfect-order/) Marvel movie and TV master list. I had to rent the 2008 Hulk movie, but everything else so far has been on Disney+ or Netflix.I know Disney+ doesn\\'t have that yet (and this isn\\'t the same) but here is a guide on how to watch all of them before Endgame before it came out.  Though, I think some of them are missing still on Disney+ because they have some contracts still with some other streaming services.https://www.withashleyandco.com/2019/03/how-to-watch-every-marvel-movie-before-endgameWhy would you want them by release date instead of by chronological order?TV too!Release date or MCU date? In other words, would it start with the first Iron Man or the first Captain America?I watched them all based on MCU date, and it was awesome. I would not think that release date would be much fun at all. Too much back and forth.This is why I bought them on disc. I don\\'t have to worry about which service has the right to stream when.This would be seriously awful.Plus they already have it, just watch the movies in order. ???Which ones are actually available? I don’t have it yet and I was just wondering if they’re going to have every MCU on there soon.Yeah, they still don\\'t have the two Spider-Mans or Incredible Hulk.We need to all work together in this time of uncertainty! Bring me a super cut so I literally don’t have to move a finger.How do find that? I’ve read about the super cut and have wanted to watch it but haven’t had time, well guess what I have now?!You\\'ll also have to find another source to watch the two MCU Spidey movies.I can\\'t speak for OP or anyone else, but I prefer watching things in release order.Movies are always better in release order, never (or rarely) chronological.What about scenes in other movies that take place before all of those? Like Thor. A true cut by MCU date involves cutting up movies, I think. But maybe that\\'s just being pedantic.MCU date, I know Disney doesn’t have the streaming rights to all of them. But it’d been a cool thing to do during this pandemic to work with Netflix, make one super cut, and then put it on both Netflix and Disney+.Pretty sure all but Incredible Hulk and the two Spider Man films are availableAnd they\\'ll never get Spider Man because they are Sony moviesHuh, I\\'ve had Disney+ since October and I didn\\'t even noticeAt over 55 hours, I would hope you would move at least once during viewing.[removed]Yeah, that doesn\\'t surprise me, but I still have around 100 hrs to go before I get there...Very true. I think keep single films as they were originally is more important for continuity, thoughIn the US, they also don’t have Infinity War or Ant-Man and WaspEdit: a wordTactical sleeps during TDW and Ant-Man.**Please read this entire message**---> Your comment on r/DisneyPlus was removed due to a Rule 2 violation: \"No posts about piracy or VPNs.\" ---**If you believe this post was removed by mistake, please [contact the Moderators.](https://reddit.com/message/compose/?to=r/disneyplus&subject=Question%20About%20A%20Removal)****Violations may result in a temporary or permanent ban.**I think I\\'d like to see it my way, simply because no-one sane is watching it this way on their first time through the MCU. So it\\'s just more fun. Endgame would be a bloody nightmare, though.If you have Netflix, these are available on there currentlyEdit: at least in the USJust watched those again. Not great times to sleep. While TDW is not made that well, the story is fine and pretty important in the overall arc of the Infinity Saga.Ant-Man is great fun (it is The Santa Clause with ants) and you are a soulless automaton if you can\\'t smile during it.The Incredible Hulk and Iron Man 2 are the worst of the bunch and they are still watchable.If you don’t, SOMEONE you know does and will share it.I omitted those two because sleeping within the first 4 movies would be cheating hahah I don’t know why but I just never clicked with the first Ant-Man and TDW just left a lot to be desired compared to the other Phase 2 movies.  TWS, Age of Ultron and Guardians are in the top tier for me.TDW was poorly directed. I have watched it several times and I have decided that the criminally bad use of such good actors is what did it in. Yeah it is dreary, but the final battle and all the CGI throughout looked great.But, Jane and Thor did not work, zero chemistry. Loki and Odin were fine, but because they had already found their characters. Hemsworth still didn\\'t know who Thor was supposed to be. He has more fun with him in Ragnarok and finds a voice...though it is Taika\\'s voice almost entirely. He doesn\\'t seem to know what to do with Thor if he isn\\'t bouncing off of the other Avengers. Endgame was him finally finding something in the role.I have nothing bad to say about Ant-Man other than that Evangeline Lily\\'s haircut was awful. But, it still wasn\\'t as bad as Thor\\'s eyebrows being dyed blonde and Luis calls out the haircut in Ant Man and The Wasp. It\\'s a good heist movie with a simple villain like Iron Man 1. CGI was superior to everything in Phase 1.Guardians and Ultron are a step above, I agree. TWS is over hyped in my mind. It is good for what it was trying to be, tells an important story, but it isn\\'t much of a spy thriller. The revelations at the end are more like a Bond movie than a Borne movie the way people talk about it. It\\'s fine, just not that far ahead of other MCU movies for me.I really like ant-man (honestly probably more than Ant man and the wasp), the dark world is trash thoughThey need to step up their 90s and older content.Mars needs Moms might still be Disney\\'s biggest flop to date. Maybe people will watch it now 🤷When is TROS Coming?!?Oh, Fish Hooks...what a good show.For which country is this list?YES. That decade is just ignored. The Jersey. Adventures in Wonderland.  Dumbo\\'s Circus. Bear in the Blue House. Mickey Mouse Club. My Date With the President\\'s Daughter. H E Double Hockey Sticks. Aladdin the Series.  Pepper Ann.   Some of the most requested shows but they don\\'t add them.Worse than John Carter? Must have something to do with Mars.In normal circumstances it should release in July/AugustU.S.I\\'ve never seen either tbh. Historically, Mars Needs Moms was a humongous failure, like to the point they shuttered the entire production studio as a result, and  barely made back a quarter of the expenses incurred.Likely a surprise add in April now alongside Maleficent 2. Each can get them a day of good press if they spread them out.April 3 Onward,April 10 Maleficent 2,April 17 Star Wars TROS,April 24 Artemis Fowl (jk)This would be logical.As would an auto-play next feature.As would the ability to rate what you\\'ve watched. (Your suggestions are based on what you\\'ve watched, but you might not have enjoyed it and may not want to watch similar films/tv)I think with MCU they don’t want to highlight the titles they are still missing.I\\'d even settle for the ability to have user created playlists, especially if they\\'re sharable.I just want them to implement Vudu’s list feature. Then I’m good. It’s impossible to ask them to do anything right at this point so just give us the powerThey don\\'t even have a lot their TV shows in chronological order.Personally, I\\'d rather they just let us make custom playlists.Then you could do Star Wars in Machete Order, or throw MCU movies into the middle of your Agents of SHIELD rewatch. (Once Netflix\\'s streaming right expire, at least.)Why? Sounds like you already found a solution.Currently making my way through the MCU, Dr. Strange is next, and whilst it’s not ideal to have to look them up, it can be done...AND IT IS AWESOME!However, a button to play a curated list would be cool, not just for the MCU......Pixar Theory anyone?Star Wars has a section that shows the content in chronological order of when they were released, just as they were made to be watched and you should be watching them. If you are showing them to someone that has somehow never heard of the franchise, you don\\'t start them with *The Phantom Menace* and show them the movies in order of where they are in the timeline. You would be spoiling what is one of the biggest plot reveals in cinematic history in *The Empire Strikes Back*.So? Andi Mack is missing most episodes, yet that\\'s in seasonal order.In the time it took you to type that, you could have spent the time to do something actually useful.It\\'s hard to watch just the Originals without the Prequels going before it. Well, for some people at least.Is this like the imagineering documentary?They\\'re just trying to help ration the quarantine supplies.It feels like a modern streaming service behaving like an old-school TV channel. What\\'s the point of annoying the fans who bothered to wait this long, when the entire series is already out there?Didn’t someone on the sub post a tweet or something confirming it would be the whole season on launchThis is *not* the way.In the long run, this is only a problem at service launch in each region. Once it launches everywhere, each region should get future seasons at the same time and release schedule. While this sucks and is a stupid way to do things, at least it\\'s temporary.This is dumb. Especially with corona going around they should just release the whole season and then for the new Disney+ original series, then release the episodes weekly.Why? I want to binge it.This is stupid we have waited for months to finally get disney plus long after it was released in America and now they are going to make us wait even longer just to be able to finish it. I\\'m not going to bother signing up until the whole show is available it\\'s the only thing I\\'m interested in on itWhy do they keep flip flopping on this? Very annoying.They\\'ve told people on messenger that it\\'s releasing all at onceLiterally lying to potential customers... that\\'s awfulSpoiler: the child’s name is not skywalkerThis is real weird. The show is already released. I’m fine with weekly episodes of new shows as they premiere, because in my opinion that helps the health of a show and helps improve it during the entire process.But this isn’t how you build a trusting consumer base. Thankfully this won’t happen again since everything should be synced after this, but still, pretty low move.They lied to usLack of Simpsons is unacceptableThat’s stupidthe virus is probably going to delay all these shows....something to think about.  fall of 2021 might be more likely now.Surely the Lothcat is out of the bag already?I was looking forward to watching that but I don’t know if I can be bothered to watch it every weeknot being able to binge actually made me forget about the series and get bored after 3 episodes.Season 2?But what about High School Musical ?Easy solution: you don\\'t get a free trial, or you at least pay (something deadly cheap) if you want the trialDidn’t a rep confirm they were all going to drop at once?That\\'s just dumb.  But silver lining, gives UK fans something to look forward to during the quarantine.I hope in UK and Ireland they give polish dubbing to Frozen 2 at least considering number of polish people living there with families.Will this apply to clone wars season 7 too cos that is still airingI bet this comment won’t get 5 downvotesWhat about the other countries like Spain?I think as Disney+ is more global their weekly releases will be worldwide (for wherever the platform is). If you don\\'t like to illegally stream then you can watch it weekly because it should be new to you. People want everything now now now. Disney had already said long ago that their tentpole originals would be released as weekly shows on the the platform it makes sense they would be doing this. They do not want to be a \"binge\" channel like Netflix and Amazon for new content. Many a time the US has to wait months after a airing in the UK of a popular British show and yeah it sucks we cant have it closer (I really only think maybe Doctor Who, and the latter part of Sherlock released same day/soonish to the UK broadcast) but we wait and we watch it with whoever has it here the majority not going and illegally streaming it \"because it\\'s already out there\". We are talking about the company that put their content in a vault.... they will release things how they want to, and weekly keeps people talking about the show.I agree.  I fully supported the week-by-week release in the US, because it was a lot of fun to discuss the show with friends and know that everyone was on the same page, and finding out the fun surprises in the show at the same time.But now that the whole thing is out in some regions and spoilers have been widespread for months, it\\'s pointless to artificially restrict the release of episodes in other regions.  Just drop the whole thing at once.It’s a modern streaming service making sure you sign up for more than one month or the free week.It\\'s because of marketing. Disney is trying to wrangle two different demographics: their usual young fan base and the older crowd that came with Star Wars. They\\'ve got plenty of stuff for Disney fans, but people who came for Star Wars don\\'t have a ton to watch. So their rationing the Star Wars content to keep people from getting a one-month subscription, binging everything, then leaving.It seems like their plan was get people to hang around until more Marvel shows arrive, but that\\'ll be tough now that productions are postponed.Weekly releases are good but they should be worldwide. No point in holding particular regions back months after other parts of the world.Disney+ has spoken.This is exactly why I cancelled my service as soon as the show ended. I hate the forced weekly stuff. Yeah OK, you had me subscribed for two months but I still cancelled once the show was over. Netflix on the other hand I don’t even question. I just stay subscribed to that one because I know they release everything in one shot and that’s the way I like it.I guess they want to set expectations? They don\\'t want to release all of the Mandalorian to the UK/etc and then when season 2 comes along they complain it\\'s suddenly weekly...So people can’t just binge it with its free trial! They have to subscribe for itI checked on live chat and they explicitly said all 8 eps would be there March 24th! I’ve heard other people have got confirmation of that too. I’m a bit confused/disappointed :(In my opinion, it\\'s actually better week to week.  Ep1-3 can be binged together, but some of the others are \"problem of the week\" style.Then wait? I actually enjoyed seeing it weekly! It gave me something to look forward to and I usually watched each episode twice so I properly digested it.I might go on to live chat again to get some clarification, but they did explicitly say all of s1 would be there March 24th, as well as eps 1-5 of TCW. disappointing! But at least we’ll be up to date soon enough.What? There 30 seasons of itthey said that it\\'ll be available on launchYes.It won’t.Yes, but the show is already available as a whole. No reason to restrict this elsewhereI just hope everything hits every country when they come out such as mandalorian season 2 at the same time rather than delays between like normal TVIt made sense when the show launched (back in November). At this point, when everyone\\'s done talking about it and the internet is full of spoilers - it\\'s a disservice.At this point, you may as well wait for all of it to be uploaded, though. It\\'s not like the counter starts when you subscribe.There’s also a difference in spreading out episodes in terms of discussion. I talked to friends more about the mandalorian than anything Netflix simply as were all on the same episode. No need to avoid spoilers.I have a feeling it will be once disney+ is worldwideIt is their way.Disney doesn\\'t want to be like them though. The binge and done platforms. 2 weeks after Stranger Things and no one is talking about it anymore. The Witcher thanks to a catchy tune got to stay relevant a tad longer on the internet. If you were only on the platform for Star Wars no one will blame you, I\\'m only on CBS all access during the times for new Star Trek shows then the rest of it is a waste for me too. Not everyone is a binger as well. Netflix is obnoxious as hell to me. I don\\'t have time to binge a show right as it comes out and by the next week oh here\\'s another show to binge. I admit they should have had something else moderately big to come maybe a week or two after Mandalorian ended but new platforms are always rocky at the start. I guess super diehards kept around for Clone Wars?Ah that sucks. Don’t really understand the logic but what can you doThe chat has regularly given false information. They are highly unreliableAn episode a night is just my preferred way to watch stuff. A week is too long.not being able to binge made me move on after 3 episodes and stop watching all together.  slow burn made us skip over it completelyThis would be welcome change. Previous news was it will not.It didn’t make sense back then either. If you want to wait a week then you also know how to not log into sites with spoilers and you also know how to filter your Facebook feed. The excuse that everyone should wait because it reminds you of a when when we had to wait around (as if spoilers didn’t exist back then either) makes no sense Netflix got ad big as it did because we didn’t want that anymore.   So now people are complacent with Disney trying to ring us for as much money as possible.I know. Can’t believe they confidently confirmed false information to several people. I’m not excited for Tuesday anymore... you’d think they’d try to be as helpful as possible especially in these times. Oh well, at least we’ll be caught up by May.Yeah. I’ve actually thought about it and in 3 or so weeks we’ll be up to date with The Clone Wars, and Mando S1 will be over by April’s end. As annoying as it is, at least this might be the last month of having to face delays. :)Well, that\\'s technically still an option for you, you\\'ll just have to wait to start watching for a couple of months.Everyone has their different preferences. Netflix and Amazon have great shows but the dumping them all at once keeps the momentum on them short and not everyone can watch all of it in a short binge so everyone is already talking about the last episode on Day 1 and 2 of it being live. I kinda like that well when most of Disney\\'s originals are up they are kind of a more premium feel to them kinda how we all feel watching an HBO show or something. I prefer the feeling excited for a week feeling and struggle to keep up with Netflix all the time.I know, it sucks.This isn’t actually Disney Plus..Because 40 million subscribers are using it now while on lockdownHappens to me all the time, too. No issues with NetFlix, gaming, or streaming rentals.What device?The high majority of users have no problems.What do you meanI know it’s not actually Disney plus I just used it as a title I didn’t mean it literally....True I guess that makes sense, has happened to me occasionally before thoughWell I’m glad to know it’s not just mePS4Almost everybody with problems with Disney+ is using a PS4.  Seriously.That\\'s why I asked what device.Thank you, hopefully I can figure out how to fix itI believe you can only have 10 devices logged in at once. Any more and you\\'re going to have to log in again.hat\\'s your regionI miss webOSGermany.It will be available at launch dayDid you get through? I\\'m having the same issue . Was working fine yesterday . Now it\\'s constant error 42Request a title here.Well we can’t go out looking for it now, can we ? 😹Thanks for thisIt’s already going to be on Disney+ April 3!No way!!!! Thanks for telling me!Disney may not be supporting the os her ipad is runningThat’s an interesting spin off type show. I’d watch itIt’s going down to the wire. No official announcement.I get why it\\'s there for casual audiences. But this should absolutely be an option you can toggle on/off in the settings. Unfortunately, no other streaming service has given that option yet, so I don\\'t expect Disney+ to do so anytime soon.It\\'s such an annoying concept. They should just have a button on the bottom that says \"Play next episode\" or \"Suggestion: _____\". Shrinking the entire credits make them hard to read and completely disrespectful towards the people who worked hard making it.Even still, there should be an option in settings like the old Netflix used to have.on the AppleTV box, I can move the cursor over the minimized credits and click and it opens back up to full screenOn my Fire TV I can move the cursor over the box but it wont open back to full...This can be done on all platforms I\\'ve used actually.Fire TV it didn\\'t work for me.I\\'m on a shield tv which should have a very similar app to your fire tv.  I have app version 1.4.It works for me.  Move the \"cursor\" back to the credits and click the center button for select and the credits are full screen again.Thats what I\\'ve tried and it hasn\\'t worked. The cursor (white outline) just disappears.I have the exact same problem on my fire stick and it really sucks for marvel movies.No, downloads are only available on mobile and tablet devicesBut is there a way of casting mobile downloads to the TV?With a chromecast or smart tv the app should have a TV iconI don\\'t think so, maybe HDMI but I highly doubtUnless you buy a new tv (and even then) it probably won‘t be on the tv automaticallyI think I know what you\\'re talking about, and I would have to say the answer is most likely no. I\\'m not sure how to download apps on those TVs either to be honest with you (I\\'m guessing I have the same UI as you), so forgive me for not having an answer or solution, but you could always try googling it. If you get nothing, your best bet if you want Disney+ is to invest in a Amazon Fire TV Stick if not something more affordable. Best of luck!It probably won’t be available as the TV needs to run WebOS 3.0 or later.  My best advice would be to grab a recent FireTV Stick for £30 and download it on there. Doesn’t have to be a 4K one either. Just a recent one, as older models aren’t supported.I don\\'t if this will help you or not (I don\\'t own an LG Smart TV, and don\\'t know what type you have), but here\\'s an article with some information:  [https://www.support.com/how-to/how-to-add-an-app-to-an-lg-smart-tv-12441](https://www.support.com/how-to/how-to-add-an-app-to-an-lg-smart-tv-12441)It’s not a Smart TV, just a normal one!!Ok, thanks!! I already have an Amazon FireTV Stick.Get a streaming device, best way to keep up with the latest apps.Instead of pre-ordering, go for the regular monthly plan and try it for free for the first seven days. (Afterwards) you can cancel instead of paying for a full year.As an adult, it\\'s worth it for Star Wars and Marvel films and TV alone.I\\'ve never seen the Simpsons so I\\'ve been watching that since November, only on season 9. If you grew up with a lot of these shows I bet it\\'ll be great to revisit old favorites. If you\\'re not a Disney, Start Wars, Marvel fan, maybe not. It\\'s hard to say. Do you use movies and tv shows to keep you in a positive mood? I just watched the Parent Trap and that really helped calm me down after the whole panic shopping started last weekend and shelves were bare. It really worked for me!It depends on how much you like the content on there and if you are looking forward to new shows that are being made. For me I’m a huge fan of Disney, Pixar, Star Wars, Marvel, and the Simpsons so it’s 100% worth it even though I don’t have kids.If you like classic cartoons then yeah.If you like (mostly) everything Marvel related then yeah.If you like everything Star Wars related then yeah for sure.Gonna have to tell people your tastes.There is a ton of content if you like Marvel, National Geographic, and old Disney movies.New adult content streaming shows like Netflix, not so much. It is worth it for you if you like certain things, but not if you only want others.For a month there is a lot and worth it. I got bored halfway into month 2 and just kept it to finish Mandalorian then cancelled.I think so, i got no kids but it has alot of stuff we all grew up on so for that factor alone its worth it to me, not to mention all the marvel and star wars stuffAll my kids are grown and my oldest is starting her own family now. But I still subscribed to D+. Lots of good content on there, and even if it is \"family friendly\", there are no requirements that only a family can watch. I\\'ve been watch some shows that my kids used to watch and I liked (like Phineas and Ferb), and finding older movies and shows from when I was growing up (like Herbie the Love Bug movies). Plus, they also have most of the Marvel MCU movies, Pixar movies, and Star Wars movies to watch, and many of the shows in those universes.If you\\'re questioning it, though,m wait until it\\'s released and get the free trial. If you like it, then buy a monthly or annual subscription, depending on how much you think you will watch (I bought an annual one - I\\'m in the US, so we\\'ve had it for a while).If you love Star Wars and you don\\'t already have access to everything, it\\'s worth it.If you love Marvel and you don\\'t already have access to everything, it\\'s worth it.If you love Disney and you don\\'t already have access to everything, it\\'s worth it.If you love Pixar and you don\\'t already have access to everything, it\\'s worth it.Most of the stuff on the platform that I love I already own on Blu-ray. I think the best strategy for an adult is to subscribe for a month twice a year or so and watch whatever you want while you have it.It depends on what you like. I\\'m in a household of 30 somethings with no kids and it\\'s been worth it for us.My roomie and I have Disney+ and get good use of it without kids around, but we\\'re both into nostalgic old Disney shows and movies, as well as the whole Pixar collection.Personally I would say no now. Totally depends on your preferences though. I would say give a free trial a shot. I regret buying the D3 multi year thing. My 10 and 8 year old nephews will at least watch it.I would say try a month and go from there. I personally hadn’t seen the last few Pixar movies and most of Phase 1 MCU so I’ll always have something to watch. The Mandalorian and Clone Wars are really the best originals so those are great tooI think so! The mandalorian was great, and I like Disney+ for the nostalgia factor (28yo). Star Wars, National Geographic, Pixar, and marvel are all included as wellIt was worth it at the beginning when Mandalorian was coming out. We got it for four years through the deal with D23 and Verizon and my wife and I are expecting a baby soon so we’ll get plenty of use out of it. I mainly use it now for The Simpsons but I also haven’t spent a lot of time exploring their new arrivals lately.If Disney/Star Wars/Marvel/Pixar was a big part of your childhood then yes.  Most stuff on there is total nostalgia and may not have as much carry over value for the younger generation who have frankly given up on television and now watch Youtube.We are a house with two in our 30\\'s and no kids, and I use it a lot. My hubby, not so much, but he\\'s not as big of a Disney fan as I am. In addition to all the old and new movies, TV shows, Marvel, Star Wars, and D+ originals like The Mandalorian and the Jeff Goldblum show, there are some really interesting documentaries on the history of the company and The Imagineering Story is really good. I\\'d second what others have said: do the free seven day trial, and if you find yourself wanting more, go for the monthly plan.I would not pay for it. There is really very little on it unless there is some old Marvel movies you have already watched a bunch of times. The Mandalorian is very good, but not worth a subscription by itself. I would wait until we are closer to the 2nd season of that and also see if any of the original shows that are supposed to come out make it worth it.Personally I would say no. Without my children I wouldn’t be subscribed because I wouldn’t watch enough children’s movies to justify the cost. I do watch Pixar movies occasionally, but it wouldn’t be enough (for me personally) to subscribe. I’m not a big Marvel fan, but I usually watch most of the new ones in the theater when they drop. I’ve found that most of these movies don’t have any rewatch ability though, aside from just a couple. I do like Star Wars, but I own all the BluRays already. So it just depends on your situation and your interests. I would recommend doing the seven day free trial and seeing how much content on there you would actually watch regularlyDepends on how much you enjoy Disney movies, tv shows, Marvel, etc.I\\'ve enjoyed it so far! I think contrary to popular belief, season 8 has been my favorite season so farIt has always been a gap in my comedy vocabulary.I don\\'t think a year long subscription is worth it for two of us, especially since we have so many of their movies on disc. But a month is definitely worth it. Get it for a month and watch the mandalorian.If you\\'re a big Marvel or Star Wars fan, I\\'d say yesI\\'m 30, signed up for an annual plan (in case I did like it I wanted to save money), and I have barely watched it. I think I watched 4 things since it came out in November. I\\'m not saying I don\\'t like it, I just do not have a lot of interest in it. But I didn\\'t grow up in a Disney household (and I\\'ve been to Disney World once in my life). I say sign up for the deal and then if you like it, awesome. If not, well you\\'re not out that much.As a adult who lives with her boyfriend and shares a Disney plus account with my friend, we absolutely love it!!!Do you enjoy cartoons? Do you enjoy disney movies?If the answer is no to both of those then just check in when you feel like watching marvel and star wars or maybe a nat geo doc every few months or so on the cheapOh totally. Two adults here and we love itHonestly I’m not sure if I would have it right now if I didn’t have kids (and I say this as a big Star Wars and MCU fan) but if you are stuck inside might be worth it.We have three 30-somethings and use it regularlyYou’ve not seen the Simpsons? Man, you have such a journey ahead of you!Enjoy the ride because once you get to about Season 10 there\\'s a huge shift and theconsistency of gold standard quality starts to decline. You\\'ll still come across some really good episodes like Trilogy of Error post classic however.This I\\'m looking forward to see happen, I\\'m very curious if this is as true as it is widely believed, or if it\\'s just an illusion of aging.Not an illusion. All it really is though is different writers, different style.Everyone is going to have their own opinion, so it\\'s entirely possible that you\\'ll like later seasons like quite a few people did, but there is a reason the all time best episodes list mostly comes from seasons 4-9.  The show didn\\'t become unwatchable, but it did become a lot more formulaic and started repeating old plotlines, such as \"The Simpsons visit X country!\" or \"Another episode set in the future!\"  Originality took a dive.Enjoy!!Geez, pinocchio is scary!  :OI\\'m doing the same. Classic animation is amazing.I love this movie1080p If screen is less than 4K, but also I believe on some computers/browsers it may be limited to 720p max.That\\'s annoying.I can\\'t fake a 4k screen on an android, right?No, and on smaller screens it wouldn’t make a difference anyway compared to HD, just use up more data. Some androids have HDR screens though, so you can watch in HD with HDR.Alas, that\\'s technically only Google pixel 2 onwards. Oh well. Thanks!I\\'m having this exact same problem. I can\\'t get the video to even start though. As soon as I hit play, it acts like it\\'s loading up and then Code 83.https://www.disneyplusinformer.com/disney-error-codes/Try to clear the cache, that helped me out.Settings -App -Disney+ -Data- Clear cache.I hope they fix this- I was trying to use this sudden free time to finally watch the marvel movies, but I can’t watch for five minutes without this happeningThis was uselessIt tells you what error 83 means. What do you want? Magic beans?There are no plans to include those. Sony owns the rights to Spider-Man. Disney and Sony had a deal to include Spider-Man in a couple Avenger movies, which Disney owns the rights to, and they used some of the MCU characters in the Spider-Man movies. Just because they are in the same cinematic universe does not mean the rights are owned by the same people.Paramount still owns the distribution rights for the four existing Indiana Jones movies. Disney would have to strike a deal with them, and it would have to wait until whenever their current contract with Netflix ends. I wouldn\\'t hold my breath on it.  You may have failed to notice the other missing MCU film, Incredible Hulk, which Universal continues to own distribution rights to... as well as any future \"Hulk\" movies, which is why we haven\\'t had any \"Hulk\" solo movies since then.NO. Disney does not own those.The Indy movies will for sure be put on there by the time Indy 5 is released, but as of right now there isn\\'t any plans for the near future.In Australia Indian Jones is on Netflix.Maybe try looking there.Indiana Jones is on NetflixSpidey isn\\'t happening, unless Sony Pictures implodes and Disney gets full custody back, unfortunately.Indy, no idea. But since Paramount has the distribution rights, I wouldn\\'t count on it coming aroundPlease take your time to search this sub for \"Spider\", \"rights\", and \"available\".Simply put, the Spider-Man licences are distributed amongst various production entities that are not all (if any) Disney, so it will be hard to consolidate all of the franchise on Disney Plus.Okay, that’s Spider-Man though. Indiana Jones is more popular. What about those?I guess that makes sense. But, I feel like thats a long time. Oh well.My bad that ones on me. Should have known about the licensing rights on Spiderman.Distribution rights belong to Paramount.In France too, first episode, 24th March, on C8 channel.That timeslot though? Is anyone gonna be awake to see it?It\\'s actually not that late. You will only have to stay selected until 00:30 (in Italy). It can be done.Bruni confuses me - they didn’t need it other than adding a pascal type chapter for the cute factor. Did they even say the name of Bruni at all?Also, when >!Ana, Elsa and Olaf find their parents ship - Bruni is with them - and then when Elsa pushes them away, no Bruni to be found.   They could have had Bruni thaw Elsa since she helped him!<When are Homer or Bart profile icons gonna be added?They should add more SW and Marvel onesI’m waiting for the Clone Wars iconsNo love for Honeymaren? DamnWe still need ScroogeBut Zorro season 1? Heck no!Not satisfied until there are Muppets profile iconsI didn\\'t know Bruni\\'s name so I called him \"chicken nugget\" unitl I found his nameI just saw Frozen 2 for the first time a few days ago. I had no idea that the lizard\\'s name was \"Bruni\".Also, I found it a little weird that the fire spirit was personified as a cute friendly lizard but none of the other elemental spirits are personified like that unless you count the earth giants and Elsa\\'s water horse.Oh great, more male avatars.They don\\'t mention his name in the film at all. My wife and I didn\\'t find out his name until we saw a plush of him in a store one day.And Pascal is wayyyy better than this guy. Probably one of the best animal sidekicks ever in fact.He probably wouldn\\'t have been able to participate in the swimming through the north seaJust watched Frozen 2 last night. I really don\\'t understand the appeal of this franchise. I\\'m a big fan of all of the other Disney animation stuff, but I just thought it was a pretty bad and boring movie all in all.Hopefully soonJust more in general, like wheres my Oogie, Zero, and Rex?Still want Captain MarvelAt least they have *Rebels* for the time being. Pretty glad I got Chopper.Or other Star Wars characters I seriously don’t know what it is but they have a bunch of Rebels guys, a bunch of droids, a couple of the faceless live-action characters (Kylo with a mask, Vader). I thought that maybe all the icons were from strictly Disney Star Wars media, so having Kylo and droids and Rebels and Mandalorian characters makes sense, Vader there makes sense (Rogue One), but then they have prequel Yoda? So idk why you wouldn’t or couldn’t have the young versions Luke Skywalker or Han or Leia or Chewbacca, Obi-Wan or Anakin. Like, why not?Where did you find a plush of him?? Uh, it’s for science.To Frozen 2’s credit, Disney didn’t choose to basically repeat the first Frozen. They decided to go a very different direction with the story, and I respect that.While the story\\'s like, plain face is pretty bad, I enjoyed the character interactions and the songs. Plus \"My love isn\\'t fragile\" (I won\\'t leave you just because you upset me) and \"When you\\'re overwhelmed/can\\'t see a way forward, just do the next right thing\" are decent messages for childrenIt’s all about the songs - the songs are really good, in both.AgreedWe originally found him at one of the Target Disney stores during the theatrical release of the movie. My wife got me one for Christmas and he\\'s become a travel buddy when we go to the parks (he sits on my hat).He\\'s available online currently:https://www.shopdisney.com/salamander-frozen-2-mini-bean-bag-4-12-412353192170.html?efc=179006&CMP=KNC-DSSGoogle&gclsrc=aw.ds&&gclid=CjwKCAjwsMzzBRACEiwAx4lLG4KfxnLe_qyCtZOwEIfWrqKk66VGOjokj9BwZ65x0YrVf18lDpAkeBoCZ3QQAvD_BwESorry for the long URL, I don\\'t know how to shorten them yet.True! I\\'ll give props for that! Just kind of felt like they didn\\'t really have a cohesive vision of what that direction was. It just felt messy and the pacing was all over the place and I didn\\'t end up caring more or less about any of the characters than I did after the first one.The bright colors and Elsa’s pretty dress also help.I still, to this day, hold Fixer Upper from the first one to be the most terrible song in all of the modern Disney films, maybe ever. It\\'s about forcing someone into marriage even though they\\'re engaged to someone else. \"Her quote \\'engagement\\' is a flex arrangementAnd by the way I don\\'t see no ring.\" Absolutely terrible.I don\\'t know, there really weren\\'t any standout songs to me in this one compared to the first one. And I don\\'t think any of the Frozen songs are as good as any of the songs in Moana, which actually had good and interesting writing and plot lines. I honestly don\\'t know how a 6-year-old watches Frozen 2 and comes away understanding what they just watched. It was really convoluted and messy.Thank you! Much appreciated.I also dislike this song but realize it reflects on the annoying little trolls, not “society” or anything.  The trolls are pushy, overbearing, and opinionated.  They’re like people you barely know that are way too interested in your life.  They’re not right and they anger the person they’re talking about, but they have “your best interest” at heart even if they’re assholes about it.Really? Other than the one moana song, I’d say there are way more sing Along type songs in frozen - that’s just my opinion as a 39 year old dad with two younger daughters.Okay, I’ll preface this with the disclaimer that I still haven’t seen the original Frozen, and I’m barely familiar with its featured song. That being said, I’m (unreasonably) very bitter that the Frozen franchise has been so overglorified, but Moana (after its initial hype) has kinda fallen off. It felt incredibly unique as a stand-alone story in the Disney animation universe, but hasn’t been as beloved. It’s especially fascinating to me that Idina Menzel was mostly “only” known from Wicked and RENT, but her Frozen performance has lifted her notoriety to where it is now.You\\'re welcome!This show along with Aladdin the Series are glaring omissions. it seems like people are constantly requesting them and also buzz lightyear of Star command. Unfortunately they haven\\'t streamed on Netflix or Hulu in the past and at the moment Disney seems only interested in adding content that has streamed elsewhere and has already been properly digitized. Keep requesting please. It\\'s quite likely we have a solid year before they start adding more of these requests because of the extra work involved.Help.disneyplus.com / give feedback / request a showLet me guess, PS4?No.  Using Roku Ultra on a 53 inch TV non-4K.Huh first time I\\'ve heard about that.Anyhow, it\\'s likely a problem with the Roku Disney+ app since if it were due to the large number of people using Disney+ right now more people would\\'ve experienced this as well.I was just waiting for you to say you have a PlayStation 4.I don\\'t have any more issues with Disney Plus than other services. Hulu is actually being really bad the past few days.I don\\'t think you mentioned what device you are using, that is a big differentiator and if you are using a wired or wireless connection (though that should cause an issue if other apps work fine through same connection type). I have been using Disney plus on an apple tv4k and an amazon fire tv version 2 since release date with absolutely zero problems.Netflix and Amazon have had years of service to perfect their app. Disney Plus isn\\'t even 1/2 year old yet. Not to mention the amount of traffic that\"s happening now due to people being on self quarantine. Of course they are going to have issues.I\\'m on a Roku and only in the first week, week and a half did I have issues and then it smoothed out.  I never have issues with it now.We mainly use it on AppleTV and it does this little pause every now and then. It isn\\'t super annoying, but I notice it. It definitely isn\\'t our internet either.I cast it to an external Chromecast device via my iPhone XS. I never have lagging issues.The only thing is that whenever I start up anything on Disney+, it will play normally for a few seconds, then buffer for a few seconds, and then play normally for the entire rest of the video. That seems to happen consistently every time I watch anything on Disney+. I haven\\'t sent any kind of trouble ticket or complaint though because it\\'s not really much of a problem. As long as it just does it the one time at the beginning of the video and then plays normally for the rest of it, I really don\\'t care.I have the same issue, I live in the UK and my internet speed is 115Mbps. I watch on my browser (Gaming PC) and always shows this message: ***\" err... this isn\\'t loading properly. Please try again, or choose something different.\"***Very lame, I\\'ve been paying for this over a year and always suffer the same issue, as you, I\\'ve been waiting for a \"fix\" but ain\\'t happening and never will as the service is shutting down in a couple of days. I am not buying the new service as clearly they don\\'t give a toss about these issues, which is something that has been affected a lot of users. Anyhow, I\\'m off.Same problem on Firestick 4k.> I can run Netflix on my tv upstairs. Surf the internet on my laptop. Kids watching YouTube on the tablet. And Alexa running music in the kitchen. All at the same time and have zero issues. Maybe adding Disney+ to play at the same with all these others is the straw that breaks the camel\\'s back.> Before you suggest it, Ive tried all the suggestions online... Multiple times. It\\'s not an issue on my end. Since I do not also experience this problem, I have to say that it is a problem on your end. It\\'s not a problem with the Disney+ servers or I would be having it also. But I don\\'t, and stream multiple things at the same time with no problems. I even stream D+ over wifi and have no problems (slower speed and half duplex). What device are you trying it on? Have you tried it on one of the other devices you stream with (you said you also have an upstairs TV and a tablet; I also assume you probably have a smart phone also). What happens on these devices? Have you tried a wired connection for the device you are streaming D+ on? How far from the router is this device? Does it work if it\\'s closer to the router and getting a stronger signal? If it does, maybe a wifi bridge is needed to improve your signal strength.You types a lot of words in your post, but didn\\'t really give a lot of information.I haven’t even tried the ps4 app in ages. Is it still having issues?Yup- it does not want to work on PS4. Most days it just has some lag at the beginning of the episode. Today it doesn\\'t work at all- we can watch about 5 minutes of Disney Plus before it says our internet is disconnected. So, we watched a movie on Netflix instead. Internet wasn\\'t ever actually disconnected. My PS4 is connected via ethernet with speeds around 80 Mbps and still can\\'t run Disney Plus. It works fine on my laptop in the bedroom furthest from WIFI with 20 Mbps internet though.. lolI\\'ve never used it, but it seems like almost all of the issues posted here come from PS4 users.Yeah I\\'ve got 200mbs hardwired Playstation and still get occasional stuttering. Something isn\\'t optimized. Dunno who\\'s end it\\'s breaking onMaybe Disney’s breaking it on purpose so they can get back the Spider Man rights?My guess, next year :(I second that. All signs point to middle east and Asia getting it 2021That would be utter nonsense.Lots of Star Wars and MCU fans here wanting to watch the ongoing and upcoming shows.Guess it\\'s not looking good huhI hope they add it at some pointhttps://help.disneyplus.com/cspSuggest it hereI don’t think it’s a Disney show. Or has Disney bought the rights to it?Disney did buy the full rights, it was specifically included with the sale of the Muppets.What a time to be alive!!!Take that, coronavirus.I wish they would add Jett Jackson: The MovieNow can they add better movies.What will they change next!?Cool. When can I watch Star Wars in English in Canada?It was a bug last time I checked.Crazy times we live inBad feeling it will never arrive. Jett is now owned by WildBrain and their content goes to CBS All Access...You already can! It\\'s two words; not one.Just the opening crawl is in FrenchTimes are changing.I didn’t know that!It’s so sad, I loved that show. It was my favorite original series of theirs, I felt like seasons 2 and 3 were some of the most mature television they’ve produced. RIP Lee Thompson Young.Ch-ch-ch-ch-changesI agree with you. I believe that is why it\\'s the only DCOM that they didn\\'t add to the service.But what makes things confusing is the film was on the DisneyNow streaming site for cable subscribers in February for Black history month... So maybe a glimmer of hope.Are you watching on PlayStation?ChromebookIt\\'s an issue going on right now. It does not seem to be working well on many devices. I can only get it working on chrome on my laptop.If you have an ad-blocker, try disabling it.nevermind.... apparently i had signed up for the trial before, i actually did have an account lmaobut it should have said thatYour account will remain even if you cancel your subscription. You would have to call them to have the account deleted (some crazy laws in California). But I agree that they should have at least told you an account with that email address already existed.solved!its fine i reset my password and moved on.... just bad web design on that partThe PlayStation app is really roughYou watch it off the website if you are doing it from computersHow do you watch Netflix, Prime, NowTV and whatnot? Its available on the same devices as an all. Xbox, fire sticks, smart tvsFor the North American launch, we got the app (for most devices) the night before.Ok I’ll have to look into Apple TV or somewhatNetflix, Prime is via tv channels on virgin media. Now tv I have a stick but I watch via laptop or Xbox depending on what mood I’m in and where I am at the time of watchingNo, whatever TV you have it will probably have the app for Disney+I have virgin mediaWhat brand tv do you use.BushI’ve never heard of that brand, I don’t know if there will be an app for it on there.Probably not. It’s a 🇬🇧 brandOn what device?Odd, it keeps giving me “something went wrong” when I try to stream Thor; but now that I’ve downloaded it, I can watch it.Its working now. A few days later. I still have no idea why it didn\\'t let me, or even show the option before.Galaxy Note 8. (android 9, kernel 4.4.153). I have 16gb of space available still also, if that was the problem, but I can download plenty of other shows still.AFV on Disney plus?!!! That was my childhood, but i doubt the humour aged well, since it’s mostly for families. That’s why we have YouTube.So psyched for Rapunzel\\'s Tangled Adventure Season 3. I\\'m a grown adult with zero kids but I found myself watching every episode of the first two seasons and really enjoying it. Comparable with Aladdin the series and The Little Mermaid animated series in quality, really builds on the characters in the movie and gets some interesting world building without ruining the events of the movie. Also Mandy Moore is a national treasure.Since Sonny with a Chance is coming in April, So Random! could be arriving in mayAnd since just roll with it will be arriving in April, Gabby Duran and the Unsittables could be arriving in mayFINALLY Sonny With A Chance! Now I just need American Dragon and Famous Jett Jackson then I’m happy.Thank you for the comprehensive list!But will they fix the simpsons format issues?Lambert the Sheepish Lion FTW.Still no Aladdin series.Still sad there is no mention of American Dragon yet. I’m excited about season 3 of Rapunzel’s Tangled Adventure though!They\\'d do us all a great service by putting the year next to the movie title (or series title).Is that 2020 Doolittle?  Or the 1967 one? or the 1998 one.Fish hooks!!Awww i thought season 3 of tangled would be earlier in the month, but a confirmed date is great!NATIONAL TREASURE!Yay for more classic shorts! I’ve been loving watching them, especially the narrated Goofy “How To” shorts. More of those, please. :)It’s about time we get Fish books :,)I believe Mars Needs Moms, Prom, The Odd Life of Timothy Green, and Frankenweenie are also coming this month.I never thought I would be so excited for new PJ Masks episodes. These are trying times, but I can NOT  keep watching the same 2 seasons for the duration of this lockdown.What the heck is up with malcolm in the middleWow... the US keeps getting more and more classic cartoons. In the Netherlands we still have only the 10 we started with at launch, plus The Ugly Duckling (1939) which was added in December or so.Finally, more short subject cartoons! Our of Scale is a personal favorite, as is Lambert the Sheepish Lion. And I’m excited for The Olympic Elk!1.\\tCory in the House2.\\tZeke and Luther3.\\tLloyd In Space4.\\tKick Buttowski5.\\tAladdin The Animated Series6.\\tTarzan The Animated Series7.\\tAmerican Dragon Jake Long*(fingers cross for these soon)*Another month of no Aladdin TV series. I am beginning to lose hope. :(Was hoping for Angels in the OutfieldDisney+ is great for families, but something that is less often discussed is that it is great for stoners as well. As mindless, humorous content, AFV will be a wonderful addition for both groups!TANGLED SEASON 3 IS FINALLY COMING!!!! YAAAAYthis doesnt mean anything. Disney has a habit of saying shows will he there and then releasing 2 or 3 on the platform. Do when you post shows and dates is a hollow piece of information.Awesome, the siege of mandalore debuts on my birthday..so can\\'t wait for that epic duel and start the wheels of rebels and everything elseStoked to see Penguins and Dolphin Reef are on the way - and so soon!! Hoping we get some news on more of the upcoming D+ original movies soonAFV, Fish Hooks, and Sonny? Yes!!April 3rd...are almost all of those classic shorts?Still need The Jersey.And what\\'s the likelihood of getting Canadian shows like Naturally Sadie?Still no Legend of Tarzan seriesNice, how to play football and secrets of the zoo. That makes me wonder if Columbus is already on it (or San Diego) and gives me hope for the Teronga zoo in the near future.What is Be Our Chef? I can’t find it on Disney+Here I was thinking I’d never see the day a David Lynch film streamed on Disney+ ... yet here we are. Totally forgot about The Straight Story!Is that the RDJ Doctor Doolittle?Edit: I now remember that that one was just called Dolittle.Because movie theaters around the world are closed, I think that Disney should have the movies coming out that they haven\\'t delayed on Disney +, and have it cost 5-10$ to rent.Can I please just have Raven’s Home season 3?FISH HOOKS OMG YESSSS YES F YEsSadly, I can no longer get excited. This is the best lineup yet, one that actually looks \"full,\" but as Wicked Tuna 3-7, Wicked Tuna Outer Banks 1-2, Three on the Run, and Zorro season 1 showed us in the past 2 weeks, they can\\'t be trusted. Not only that, none of those even show as appearing in April. They just brushed them under the rug.Most surprising - Elephants is still MIA and I was under the impression it would be added along with Penguins and Dolphin Reef.Also surprising? AFV (finally) arriving as I\\'ve always expected. But offering a random set  of seasons. Hopefully they intend to fill in the gaps...When is Star Wars 9? Palpatine Strikes Back? Date?Disney should give a month freeAll the VCR gags might be lost on the current generationWell it’s the newer seasons unfortunatelyAlso, some videos in the early days were filmed with handheld cameras, with the appropiate date artifacts in the corner!YES. I am hyped for this. I already spoiled the season finale for myself, but DAMN what a path to get there.If you liked that, you\\'d probably also like Sofia the First and its\\' spinoff Elena of Avalor.It says seasons 1-3 with Sonny, so I think they’ve grouped So Random with it, which makes sense as it was supposed to be the third season before the retool.Hoping for Jett Jackson myself.Asking the important questions.Probably when they fix the Ducktales order.Aka: whenever they feel like it.Probably when they fix the Ducktales order.Aka: whenever they feel like it./sI absolutely loved that cartoon growing up! So happy to see it on the service!I know right!! 😭😭😭 It was my only wish for Disney Plus.And no mention of Cory in the HouseIt\\'s not the 2020 for sure cause that isn\\'t Disney lolDespite them not saying (Returning title) next to it as they have done for Finest Hours and Sandlot, it will be that one. Why? I posted a list of never-before-seen expiration dates from Starz and HBO a week back and revealed Doctor Dolittle 1967 expires from Starz May 31. In other words, it won\\'t appear until June 1st.This makes sense because the 1998 one that left is not currently streamable anywhere.Yeah, it\\'s odd there\\'s a longer wait for that than there is for Just Roll With It. Rapunzel ended a week earlier.They are, he forgot to copy them from his list.  Also, The Last Song too.I can relate. My youngest cousin has been watching both of those seasons constantly for several months now, and it gets old really fast. Hopefully Netflix gets this new season sooner rather than later.They will add it later. They can\\'t just drop everything at once. It could be 2022 until they drop it cause they own so muchExactly.Three on the Run.ZorroWicked Tuna Outer BanksWicked Tuna seasons 3-7and that\\'s JUST the past 2.5 weeks.I\\'d say slim on Sadie. It\\'s now owned by WildBrain :(  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WildBrain\\\\_Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WildBrain_Studios)It’s a new cooking show, first episode hasn’t debuted yet.It’s a family cooking  competition show where the winning team’s creation will be on the menu at Walt Disney world.NoThey would lose billions of dollars doing that. Movie theaters sell tickets at like $10-20 a person. Your idea would be $5-10 for an entire household (and whoever they share their passwords with).It would turn every single one of their releases into a financial flop.They announced this morning that Onward is coming to digital to own tonight for $20, and Disney+ on April 3rdThey’re already losing basically all their  income cause of the quarantine they’ll never give D+ for free now.Why *should* they do that?They gave a *year* free already.lol, they are already losing $20 million a day from the parks being closed, along with who knows how many billions from all these theatrical delays. They can\\'t afford to give us a free month without becoming vulnerable to a hostile take over (which actually might happen with Apple apparently).I hope we get the Tom Bergeron episodes. He’s a funny host.Ok boomerarnt they on Hulu?They used to have cameras that your had to put over your shoulder alsoOh, I didn\\'t think of that fact. Yeah, that would certainly be nice if So Random is included, but in the past they have made a lot of typos on these announcement lists so I\\'ll wait to get excited. For example, Zorro season 1 never came. Wicked Tuna seasons 3-7 never came. Outer Banks seasons 1-2 never came. Malcolm in the Middle never came. When it comes to shows they announce, they aren\\'t doing well with following through.And I\\'m hoping Cory in the House. (I\\'m still surprised Cory in the House wasn\\'t at launch, that and American Dragon.)Don’t count on it. Disney only owns the movie.I heard a bad rumor... Jett Jackson will NEVER show up because Disney no longer owns it. It is owned by WildBrain. This would explain it\\'s DCOM being the only one missing as well :(  :(   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\\\\_Famous\\\\_Jett\\\\_Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Famous_Jett_Jackson)And the Phineas and Ferb order and adding Cory in the House.True! How could I forget that oneAnd the 2020 one is called Dolittle, not Doctor DolittleIt\\'s most definitely not odd. The network cares very little for tangled the series :(Well I can\\'t seem to find it digitally anywhere.When does it debutOoh sounds interesting. How come I can’t find it though on Disney+?Good. That should stay buriedJust looked, all of the episodes being added are from the Tom Bergeron eraIt\\'s only the newer seasons on there too.I didn’t know if it would be this or the fact that the actor committed suicide would keep Disney from adding it. Either way I hope they can work something out so we can see it again and enjoy his talent.What about Kick Buttowski, Lloyd in Space, and Zeke and Luther? +1 for American Dragon Jake Long and Cory in the HouseIt makes me sad! Tangled has always been one of my favorite movies and I love the show so much. It’s a shame they don’t seem to care much for it.Oh. True. considering Tangled is one of their most popular films I honestly don\\'t understand how they buried that series. it\\'s insane. The show is so goodYeah, but sadly WildBrain deals look to be going to CBS or HBO MaxFirst episode is March 27. You can see a trailer for it here https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.eater.com/platform/amp/2020/2/18/21142863/disney-plus-family-cooking-competition-be-our-chef-premieres-march-27As sad as that is I really doubt it would keep them from sharing his work. My money is on rights issues :(Yeah :(It\\'s so insane! They had little to no advertisement. Moved it to such an early time on a sunday???? At least they did fund for the soundtrack releases. I asked the producer Chris about other possibilities (like piano books or instrumental albums) but he says disney has no plans on doing soThank you!Yeah. I still hope they can work something out. He was such a great actor. It would be a shame to not share it with another generation.It took Descendants 3 about 6 months to get to Disney Plus after its TV debut.It\\'s on the Disney Now app if you have a cable subscription.  It\\'s in the blu ray/digital sales period now.  When they feel like they made enough in sales, they\\'ll put it on Disney Plus. I don\\'t think anything will go from tv immediately to Disney Plus.I\\'d say give it another month, but that\\'s just a guess. 2-3 months is generally a good guideline.Zombies 2 will most likely debut by August as it is currently on Disney NowYeah, that’s part of what annoys me; it’s on DisneyNOW, the free if it’s in your cable package service, but not DisneyPlus, the I pay you far more every month than you get from the cable company for my subscription. It’s not a first run movie they are looking to get as much as possible out of in disc and digital purchases, it’s a made for TV movie that they are showing. Why do I need to search multiple apps for content. For me, it undermines the utility of DisneyPlus if they continue to play games with show availability.They don\\'t want people to drop their cable subscriptions in favor of Disney Plus. They want revenue from both.  So right now it\\'s available for cable subscribers and people who want to own it.  Then it\\'ll go to Disney Plus.Mighty full of themselves if they think delaying the availability in DisneyPlus in any way incentivized folks to keep their cable bill. I have a cable package because it’s free with my high speed Internet; if TV paragraph cost me $10 more they would be gone like a hot potato.But it still comes down to protecting a $1.50 a month revenue stream (my guess at what the package of 3 Disney channels cost per subscriber to a cable company) at the cost of a $8/mo revenue stream (what I’ll be billed once my heavily discounted 3 year subscription runs out.And guess what? My daughter hasn’t seen the stupid movie all the way through; she was super excited when it came out but by making it difficult for her to watch, she’s pretty much forgotten about it. So...She’s not hooked on the songsShe isn’t buying Zombies 2 merchandise She’s that much less interested in Disney Properties So congrats to Disney marketing geniuses, way to show my daughter DisneyPlus is the last place to look for entertainment.I just sent in a request for them... we’ll see how it goes.Modern FamilyThe WeekendersThe Legend of TarzanThe lack of these two shows is almost enough to make me not renew my subscription.

Thumbelina is on Disney Plus and that’s not even Disney Plus either!It\\'s coming to D+ along with Fish Hooks on Apr. 3!Yes! All 5 seasons please!Wait.....where did you hear that?The Simpsons and Thumbelina were both made by Fox Studios. Disney bought Fox Studios last year. The Simpsons and Thumbelina are both technically Disney now.Yes! That was such a good showThey released their list of April releases to the pressHonestly I think Disney needs to stop buying other companies. I like Disney but it is absolutely not healthy for them to own everything.I\\'m kind of surprised that it has any of the show at all, to be honest. It\\'s a licensed thing, not one they produced themselves (and probably not even one they have permanent rights to), and Netflix seems to have streaming rights to more of it than they do.[Disney Plus Release Schedule](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=when+is+season+3+of+miraculous+coming+to+disney+plus)You can request a show/movie on the Disney Plus website by going here https://help.disneyplus.com/csp and clicking on \"give feedback.\"I hope so!Which \"Prince Charming\"?

Someone working on icons might have only kept Snow Whites Prince Charming and not Cinderella.The one from Cinderella. Disney never owned Shrek.Isn\\'t he the one next to Cinderella under the Disney Classics? At first I saw a blank spot, but after tapping on it, the icon appeared...Yes\".@EvaLongoria and Benjamin Bratt bring you... A Celebration of the Music from Coco, streaming Apr. 10 on #DisneyPlus.\"   >publisher: @disneyplus   >links in tweet: https://i.imgur.com/UGz3Rdc.jpgThey will put it on digital buy/rent first for a few months before putting it straight on Disney Plus.It won\\'t happen. If they release it in cinemas, every single person who is watching it, has paid to see it (not counting people who sneak in). If they release it on Disney+, even behind a paywall, with families and shared accounts, there\\'d be maybe 1 in 5 people actually paying to watch it. It wouldn\\'t make anywhere near enough money.Neither Widow nor Mulan will be streaming. Before the virus, each was supposed to pass 1 billion. Even after the virus, I think both will make 500 million.  That’s a lot more capital than that which would be gained by new subscribers to D+ for these films. To make up the $1 billion they’d lose from Widow and Mulan (both only grossing 500 million) not playing in theaters, D+ would need over 100 million new subscribers for 1 month.There are rumors that Disney is considering releasing the live action Mulan on D+ because of the virus, so this may not be too far off.Not a chance in hell this is getting released on streaming.  Even if the delay the movie is still going to make a minimum of 400 million.If Universal makes some decent money the next couple weeks with their current releases at $20 as a rental other companies will take notice. That’s a decent price point for a current release.It’d be cool if you could pay and ‘unlock’ new releases like Black Widow on Disney Plus and then you would have access to it for good. It could be $15 or $20 to start and drop in price over time until its included in the app for all.It\\'ll happen eventually.Catch ya later!!!Honestly if disney did this with Mulan OR Black Widow I would run through the streets naked.Listen k love Disney +, but I\\'d be heart broken if it wasnt in theatersThey already announced that they’re postponing it: https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/17/disney-pushes-black-widow-from-may-1-release-and-it-could-impact-the-whole-marvel-slate.html?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmfI don’t think BW will come to D+ anytime soon, the MCU is just too much of a moneymaker for them. However I could see Disney putting Mulan or New Mutants on D+ temporarily, only to be released in theatres later on.Onward should come out on there now.I\\'ve heard rumors since before any of this even started that studios were considering releasing theatrical movies at home for a higher price. I\\'d definitely pay a good $50 to watch it at home in the next few weeks.Also put Rise of Skywalker on there early like they did Frozen 2. That will add another movie to be on continuous play. I’ve heard parents are complaining of now having Frozen 2 memorizedI’d happily pay £15 or something to stream something like BW on release, even if it’s just to watch it once. I do think there’s a market there for that sort of stuff and D+ is prime for it.You can keep that one. Terrible movie!Releasing Black Widow (or any other unreleased film) digitally may not make the studio as much money, but some studios are in a much better position to take a hit financially. They could actually turn this into a not so new business model of VOD. I get a lot of people want to wait and see it in the theater, but we don’t know if that’s an option in the foreseeable future. That said, Black Widow ( and The New Mutants) would be really cool to watch at home during this time when a lot of people aren’t leaving the house.Canceled my Disney+ subscription after mandalorian ended. I plan to renew for one month every year at Christmas to binge what I missed and watch Christmas specials. Getting simultaneous or delayed premiers on the service would bring me back permanently.Do it with Mulan and we got a deal.I’m good with that tooNo. They just announced that they’re pushing the release date.https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/17/disney-pushes-black-widow-from-may-1-release-and-it-could-impact-the-whole-marvel-slate.html?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmfYou\\'re seeing the economics incorrectly.If they were to premier Black Widow on Disney+ and make it an exclusive, the goal would be to see how many $6/month subscriptions they could add and maintain.  This could be especially important as there are several complaints of no new content on the service.For example.  Sure, the movie might make $1 billion.  But if you can get 33 million new subscribers (won\\'t happen, but as a high end) and make an additional $200 million a month, in 5 months you will exceed that $1 billion.  So maybe the ROI is 10 months or a year, but you keep on making most of that money monthly forever.That\\'s a monthly chunk of change that they will get from now on.  So the economics are a little different.  People who already have Disney+ watching Black Widow is actually only a cost.  It\\'s new and ongoing subscriptions that make them money.[removed]I see that argument a lot and it’s a good one, but how much do they lose through delaying it?  Everyone knows that merch is how they make most of their money so releasing it through Disney+ earlier and thus being able to sell their merch earlier would let them recuperate their funds. Plus, we aren’t sure how BW would connect to the Disney+ series so maybe this will have a knock on effect with the shows and thus delaying them would push people to hold off subscribing for a bit as well.I doubt this will affect them or at least Black Widow making it to $1B.I don\\'t see it. That movie will print money.Same with Mulan. They’re way, way too expensive.You sure about that?  Movies are over indefinitely now until there\\'s a cure. When\\'s the world going to go back to normal?  This virus might stick around forever, there\\'s no designated quiting time or weekends off.   It\\'s here until a vaccine is developed.   Could be years.   Who wants to go anywhere where anything you touch or the air you breathe in a crowded room can kill you or infect you and you kill your loved ones?Sorry, tough truth.Edit:wordTotally reasonableThe Universal movies don\\'t have the budgets of movies like Black Widow and the Universal movies weren\\'t going to make any more money at the box office then they already had.  Bloodshot in a better situation could\\'ve made a few million more at the box office but in the current climate it was done as a box office draw.Heck even $25 would be fair. That way theaters could still operate at around $10 per ticket but allow people who don\\'t want to go out to go and stream it.Wait so I\\'m supposed to pay twice the theater price so I can watch it on my shitty TV with my shitty speakers? I get it, movie theater seats are gross and you can pause at home to go to the bathroom, but there\\'s no way in hell I\\'m paying more for a worse entertainment experience.That’s basically iTunes.That is a great ideaSounds good to me.Very true, I’d definitely pay if they make it available digitallyAnd New Mut—- actually maybe that movie is cursed.Half the people interested already have Disney plus though.  And anyone who didn\\'t would just use their trial, or pay $7 for one month. It\\'s much more likely they would do the $20 rental plan.Your post on the Disney+ Subreddit was removed due to a Rule 2 violation:\"No posts about piracy or VPNs.

Neither do I. Some people on this thread seem to think that Disney may release Widow on streaming similar to how Universal handled Trolls 2. Im just commenting saying “I doubt that.” They’ll simply postpone Black Widow, probably just shift it to “The Eternals” supposed release date in November, and it will make its due 1 billion. Monetarily speaking, it makes no sense to make Black Widow a D+ film. Not only would it anger Scarlett and make her not likely to reprise her role in a sequel or the like, it also makes 0 business sense to forgo the large profit the film will inevitably make.It can’t if all the movie theaters are closed. They’d have to postpone release until late in the year.Yeah people keep talking about everything being ok in a couple weeksLike...lol but thats not happening.It\\'s not though.  Because at some point the rest of the world getting on with life is going to outweigh the deaths.And recessions and especially a depression will cause more deaths than coronavirus.You can\\'t have a crappy economy forever.> Movies are over forever now until there\\'s a cure.Movies are over forever! Until they\\'re not!I was thinking just for the short term. It’s either release things this way or hold the movies off until the fall.Except Disney is too anti-consumer and won’t give us 4K on iTunesI get there’s huge implications for it, especially being a blockbuster, but in the current climate I’d be happy to book a slot, watch 30 mins of Disney previews (could be anything, games, parks, Galaxy’s Edge etc.) and then watch it. Disney...sort it out! I’ve waited long enough for Disney Plus never mind BW!Yeah, really, that thing has been through so many reshoots and script and cast changes. I thought they were going to throw their hands up in the air and say forget it long time ago.That \"curse\" is kowtowing to Chinese censors. It is Unamerican. Another reason I canceled my Disney+While I agree with your points and saying that’s what they will do, I don’t think it has anything to do with Scarlett. She gets paid the same regardless of how much the movie makes, and I seriously doubt that *if* she were to be reprising her role (let’s not forget that she doesn’t have much more time alive in the timeline), a D+ release would affect that by any means. Completely agree they won’t likely release it from a business standpoint, just don’t think that Scarlett plays a factor in the decision.Then... They will postpone itYou say that like movies aren\\'t being postponed to later in the year, or even next year, already.Mulan would kill right now as China is beginning to open back up. I mean, it’s pretty clear that movie wasn’t really made for Western audiences.If we stopped all social distancing, reopen everything and went back to life as normal, covid19 would probably burn itself out in 2-4 weeks, but 10 times as many people would die, the longer it lingers the better its working its all about keeping the number of cases controllable.Really!  This \\'a couple of weeks stuff is incredibly naive.*Maybe* it\\'s over when there\\'s been a couple months of no more outbreaks.   As of now, the numbers are climbing continuously and exponentially.Totally.   But you can\\'t have people dying either because they\\'re forced to work.Yeah that means we have no idea when.   Can\\'t say 1 month or whatever.   It is forever until there\\'s a cure.And the autumn movies will have to get pushed back too.  For Marvel Cinematic Universe, they would have to delay everything.  Black Widow, Falcon And The Winter Soldier, The Eternals, WandaVision, etc.  They have too many linked plot lines to mess with the order.They say that none of those changes actually happened. They\\'ve been getting screwed over with delaysThey delayed release the first time to avoid competing with deadpool, then deadpool got delayed to avoid competing with the MCU so New Mutants moved again. Then they moved it *again* because Fox was going to make them do reshoots, then Disney bought them out, told them the reshoots weren\\'t necessary, and then delayed it again because of the virusThose reshoots never ended up happeningYeah and it looked interesting, but too bad I guess.I think she does play a factor. She and the character have earned a blockbuster. While these are unprecedented times, I don’t think she would have agreed to do a Black Widow movie if it was only to be launched on Disney+. While it’s disappointing for us who want to see the movie, depending on when they can get it scheduled for, it can be the type of movie that brings people out of whatever funk this shutdown puts us in, and gets the fan-base hyped about Phase 4 of the MCU and beyond. You don’t risk that with Disney+ imo. I think the first thing they’ll do is release Onward for digital rent in the coming weeks followed by an arrival on Disney+ a month later. They already shot their wad with marketing on that one, and it was fairly well reviewed, so they could have a modicum if success with that release schedule.I agree if we didn\\'t social distance many more would die but the idea that it\\'ll go away is a one possible outcome.  It\\'s a theory.  It might not work out that way.   It probably won\\'t work that way.   People don\\'t listen and act like this is a joke.  Florida beaches are packed.  But not only that this virus is global.  There\\'s billions of people in India and China.  All we need is for it to get loose there again and it\\'s off to the races again.Orange County has gone from limits of 250 to 50 to essential only.  But even the 250 was effective in limiting new cases, as we\\'ve only had 3 in the past while.And we\\'ve had only 11 deaths.  Everything is falling.I guarantee you that another Great Depression will kill far more people in Orange County than 11.You mean indefinitely, then. Not forever.Yeah, it would replace one of those other Disney movie slots.  They wouldn\\'t hold it to November.  They are going to release it as soon as people are sick of being cooped up and ready to go out and do something.Yeah, I know, it makes me nervous that it\\'s had all this well publicized trouble with just simply being made. If I watch it, I\\'d have to stream it. I\\'m not putting any money out for that one. They sunk all that money into it and it still might not be any good.Thankfully, India is always over the 85° threshold, which is probably why most of their cases are foreign.Or the complete lack of testing.  Time will tell I guess.Is there anything stopping the numbers from going up?>I guarantee you that another Great Depression will kill far more people in Orange County than 11.11 is not the final number but yes another great depression will be catastrophic.Fair enough.   That\\'s definitely a better term.   I\\'ll update.Theaters are closing up in many countries and states within the US.  I can\\'t go to any AMC theater near me in Florida (I think the Governor closed them).  My go to theater in Denmark also just announced they are closing since they were struggling before but now filed for bankruptcy.Theaters will likely remain closed till all theaters in a country open up.  Same with Euroland.  It will need to be an all or nothing system since new movies won\\'t be released.Plus most productions are put on hold.  Netflix halted all productions last week.  So basically nothing new will be coming out for a while ... unless it is animated or already shot ... and people can work on the edits / CGI remotely.App will be available at release date on supported platformsWas hoping it\\'d atleast be available on Monday so I can set up my profiles and whatnot but apparently its Tuesday.I\\'m just worried with the schools being off and Europe locked down, it\\'ll be unusable the first few days.Yeah man, I have spent hours looking for the apps, TV update etc for the last few weeks. What a waste of my time. Could they not say something like this somewhere on their website? I mean, who doesn’t release the apps until the day the service is live?!?!I don\\'t know but I am in the same boat as you, mate. My TV might be too old to have it (LG 2016 4k) but it would be nice to have a TV app and not to have to rely on chromecast.I have heard the app will be on content store on the day of release 24th March.Thanks GuysI can’t remember if it was available the day before or the day of release in the USIn US they came out day of. They started at midnight but not all immediately but in phases, but all out within a few hours. Hard to say if they\\'ll do the same or not this time.We will be able to find and download the Disney+ app in a UK app store on the 24th.I live abroad but have a UK Google play store account on my phone and have to wait until the 24th to be able to download the app, so I have to use my laptop in the meantime.I was going to ask this myself!  Would be nice to have them installed and ready in advance, but we’ll see what happens!Ah that\\'s okay then! We\\'ve been checking every few days and was just getting a little stressed it maybe wasn\\'t gonna come to our TV (though its just over a year old)This isn\\'t news. They could appear, but most likely their respective licences and ownerships prohibit them from moving to Disney Plus right away.It wouldn\\'t allow me to post as \"Missing Content\" flair. I tried it a ton of times and it was some weird bug. But I think it\\'s News because the News is that NONE of those shows are coming to Disney Life UK Launch, as in, they are temporarily losing ALL that content.If you’re doing monthly payments which I assume, cancel your subscription, then download the Disney plus App on your iPhone. Login and sign up for a subscription again. It will bill to whatever apple account account is signed in on the iPhone. Hope this wasn’t confusing, it’s literally as straightforward, fast, and easy as it can be.Its wasn’t. Thanks! My billing cycle ends today. So I’ll sign back up with Apple today. ThanksNo problem!Life Size 2 is on Disney Plus but the original Life Size is not.I see all kinds of classic movies on D+ - 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, The Absent Minded Professor, The Apple Dumpling Gang, Davy Crockett, and one of my favorite classic Disney movie, Old Yeller.Newer movies, like the one you are lookign for, may not be available because of contract issues with other services, distribution rights, or they are planning ion releasing at a later date.In the US it comes May 1, 2020They’re both here for me in Australia.I’m sittin’ in a railway station...Nice!𝓷𝓲𝓬𝓮 ☜(ﾟヮﾟ☜)#Nice Leaderboard**1.** `u/RepliesNice` at **3311 nices****2.** `u/DestroyerZDude` at **3056 nices****3.** `u/bigriggs24` at **3002 nices****...****8572.** `u/dickey1331` at **5 nices**---^(I) ^(AM) ^(A) ^(BOT) ^(|) ^(REPLY) ^(**!IGNORE**) ^(AND) ^(I) ^(WILL) ^(STOP) ^(REPLYING) ^(TO) ^(YOUR) ^(COMMENTS)Okay so the only way is to call Disney Plus. And you have to resign in on all devices.This is unbelievable for a company of Disney\\'s size to not have a de-register feature built in, especially considering how many accounts were hacked and sold. What a shame.maybeEven if the phone’s screen is a higher resolution, I seriously doubt your eyes could see any difference.Just wondering, as the resolution on my phone is higher than thatI believe 50 is the limit.Yes, there\\'s a limit on what is shown. But as you keep removing items from the watchlist from watching, then those that were hidden (removed) will be added back on.Disney+ has literally become a godsend for my 2 kids. They are 4-2 and man it’s great having access to soo many great classics and newer movies.Signed up for the Mandalorian, keeping it for all the kids content.Coronavirus may sustain the userbase for quite a while.It’s the only reason I have Disney+I have 3 kids under 10 and we love it. It’s been fun watching older classic Disney movies that we didn’t have. We are trying to have family movie night once a week where we watch an older Disney movie/one they haven’t seen in a long time.I have two kids.. *BUT* they are 16 & 12 both of them gave up Netflix for Disney+. I love going back and watching the movies they loved as toddlers with them now. Not to mention Mandalorian & all the Marvel movies.Other half is divorced dadsChances are we\\'ll get Onward before long as well.my family is one of themwe are bored as *FRICK*the other half are piggy backing off the first halfSigned up for the Simpsons, still watching the Simpsons.I\\'m curious when we can expect to see Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker on there.Maybe March 31, when it gets it\\'s physical release?This is why all the “Netflix is killing Disney+” headlines make me laugh. Disney+ doesn’t have to beat Netflix to make lots of money....in the last 5 days???LolI have it for the classic kids\\' shows I haven\\'t seen in years.Signed up to watch the Mandalorian or for the Simpsons, kept because my uncle’s kids want to watch Frozen on a continuous loop or watch a specific Mickey Mouse Clubhouse episode.Signed up for Marvel and nostalgia, having it available for my 3 year old is just a bonus.If I hadn’t gotten the 3 years for the price of 2 deal I don’t know if I would keep it long term. I can only get it on my roku tv and not for our main tv that the kid usually watches. I already own a lot of Disney’s library at least the things that I do want to watch. In order for me to keep Disney+ after the three years the original tv shows are going to have to keep coming. Cause that’s what we primarily watch.The monopolyorian!The other half is using their aunt\\'s account, at least my nephew\\'s areI don\\'t have any kids.  I\\'m just a nostalgic fool.I canceled my Disney+/ESPN+/Hulu bundle in January. They went ahead and billed me for Disney+ in February. Now today I got an email telling me to I have to activate Hulubto watch it as part of the bundle to which I subscribed. I did no such thing. No idea what\\'s going on with it but it\\'s been frustrating.Do they actually watch all those classes and newer movies or do they just want to watch the same thing every single day, cause that\\'s what the deal is with my nephews and niece.I signed up for Mando, kept it for clone warsSigned up for the tent pole franchises; Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar, The Simpsons and all the new and classic Disney films. I have no kids. I\\'m older so I didn\\'t grow up watching any of The Disney Channel shows or Clone Wars so there\\'s no nostalgic factor in all that content for me and the vast majority of offerings on the platform I\\'ll never watch, but the handful of stuff I am interested in is well worth the sub price for me. I like to mention how I got in on the pre-launch 3 year deal which breaks down to less than $4 a month. That\\'s cheaper than a single HD streaming rental. I\\'m extremely happy with Disney+ and everything coming down the line is just more reasons to be stoked on it.Yeah its interesting how some industries will thrive from this but others will burn. A sad but interesting time we live in.ditto!Star Wars, Marvel, and Nat Geo don’t hurt either.Don’t forget all those older Disney Channel shows they watched way back when.Small quarter are those in their mid-20s who rely on it to decompress from the stress of work and just everyday life. We like Disney, too!Bullshit. Am divorced dad and I love itI hope so. My gf was supposed to take her kid this weekend to see it and she was really looking forward to it.Bored with Disney? Or bored because of Coronavirus?Haha, that\\'s what I was thinking too.Probably a few weeks to a month after physical releaseWhy not on the main tv?I change it up. My almost 2yo could probably watch the same thing over and over. My 4.5 yo will call me out if I put the same thing again. But he is at a good age where we can watch the Marvel movies together. So we have been slowly watching those.Lion King and Frozen II once a day.Signed up for Mando, kept it for Marvel and all the nostalgia shows/movies they have. #####plus my little brother and sisterHollywood isn\\'t really going to thrive from this... almost the entire industry is shutting down, and many studios are paying massive kill fees to freelance staff. It\\'s going to cost a fortune and they\\'re going to be feeling it 6-18 months from now after all of these cancelled or halted productions were supposed to release.I\\'m kinda looking forward to Nat Geo, about 5 years a go when i had Sky (cable TV in the UK), that was one of the top 3 channels i would watch.corona is the huge thingDoes it have to go to Netflix first?It’s a smart tv but it doesn’t have the Disney plus app on it.Dang, you are lucky, I wish the kids would let me expand their minds with different movies, but no luck.Signing up for goddam Disney films. I’m an adult and don’t need an excuse.Yeah marvel films are another reason I kept itOk, was gonna day of your bored of Disney you are doing it wrong 😂Hope it turns out all ok for your familyNot sure. I hope notStart small. I couldn\\'t get my kid to watch anything but Cars for the first month.This redditor gets it.To be fair, it is good for kids to watch/listen/do the same thing over and over again. Repetition is great for learning and understanding. But I understand some parents might get insane having to listen and watch the same medium all the time :’)Depends how I hold the iPad and if I accidentally press the volume buttons.Happens for me on iPhone constantly..It’s not that.Disney gotta make it’s money for blu rays and movie rentals first. This was made clear when it first came out.It’s the same delay as when Disney content was contracted out to Netflix. And it’s the same release model every film studio uses with their streaming partner. Movie theaters get 3-4 months of exclusivity at $10-12 per ticket. Retail has 3-4 months of exclusivity for disc / digital. Then it rolls to streaming services, premium cable networks (HBO, Showtime), basic cable and broadcast tv. Disney isn’t sacrificing that $20 disc / digital purchase window. If you don’t want to pay, wait another few months and you’ll have access to 6-month old films plus thousands of other movies and tv shows for $7 per month.You don’t have to wait for ROS. You can purchase it right now duh!!!Ah well seems I misunderstood the deal here. I thought I was paying for old movies and kids\\' tv so I\\'d be able to see new content asap. That\\'s gonna be a cancel. Thanks for the response, though.Yeah that’s never going to happen. They’ll still follow the regular release schedule give one or two months. So if that’s what you were expecting, better cancel.I\\'ll probably cancel because it feels like paying for VIP at an event, but I still have to wait in line and I have to sit with everybody who didn\\'t pay for VIP as well.Hope you don’t have Netflix. It’s literally Netflix but all Disney titles.Restart the device, in the settings,For some reason I am having trouble playing an episode of the Simpsons: Season 4 Episode 21 called Marge in Chains\"  everything else is working just fine however.Dude I\\'ve tried everything, clearing data, clearing cache, deleting the app on all devices and reinstalling them and everything but every time I open the app it just shows the Disney logo and the circle just spins and never loads anything. I guess I\\'ll call the help line or something but I dont know if they\\'re even gonna be able to tell me anything.No. No scheduled launch either. Sorry. :( Hopefully before 2021!Unfortunately they still didn\\'t implement a way to remove devices. For now it\\'s still stuck that way.What country are you in?  All episodes are there in the U.S.What episodes are missing?And Australia!My kids are extremely happy about this. Thank you, Disney.This off off topic but anyone has access to wreck it Ralph 2?And Netherlands!!I actually enjoyed Frozen 2. Good maturing themes throughout the movie.Yay!!Now is on 4K and Dolby vision AtmosI\\'m pretty sure frozen was *always* available in Canada...Wonder if all of the text is going to be in French for no reason like some movies on D+ in Canada.Frozen II has been available in Canada since 1867I was wondering if this was because of covid, or was it really scheduled like that? Like Disney+ trying to help homecare parents with entertainment for kids.It\\'s been in Disney for a days now in the us.I\\'m not the biggest technical guy, but can someone explain to me how something can be just HD but also Dolby Vision? Are Dolby Vision/HDR not by default 4K?If you are in Canada Wreck It Ralph 2 is available on Netflix currently as well as The Incredibles 2,which is also on Netflix.I am assuming you meant Ralph breaks the internet. If yes, in US it is showing as this would be available from Dec 11th 2020Thanks for the info! But I want that that Dolby vision and Atmos action!Oh thank you! I assumed that it\\'d be out by now since frozen 2 came out much laterIt’s because it’s currently on Netflix, I’m assuming. There are a bunch of movies licensed elsewhere that haven’t made it to D+ yet.Yes, eventually. A bunch of them are on DisneyLife in the UK so we know they have digitized copies. The sad thing is, none of those are coming from Disneylife to the new UK version of Disney Plus. Still, i\\'m sure they\\'ll make there way over within the next 2 years. It\\'s just odd they aren\\'t even transferring them for people in the UK that have had them for years....I’m still waiting for them to add Dog with a Blog! I loved that show!When they decide to stop Region blocking random shows.Sonny with a Chance will be added in Canada on April 3! (maybe in other countries too?)Update: I Didn\\'t Do It is supposed to be added on FridaySonny With A Chance was just announced for April 3.Possibly with So Random since they said \"Sonny Seasons 1-3\" and SWAC only ran 2 seasons...Fish Hooks coming April as well.My guess is 1-2 Disney Channel missing shows a month for a while. Probably Dog With a Blog or Ant Farm next because they seem to be the most requested.Mighty Med would be smart because it\\'s the prequel series to Lab Rats Elite Force. Gamer\\'s Guide should be added just to honor Cameron Boyce.They never said the whole library was going to be on Disney plus, some will not. I’m sure they will add over time.yeah, i was a little old for that one but I still watched it lol. i\\'m hoping more shows get added, there\\'s plenty now but I miss the ones that aren\\'t thereoh nice! i haven’t seen fish hooks in YEARS and i completely forgot about i didn’t do it. i’m excited. and i always thought lab rats elite force was just connected to lab rats? that’s interesting. i only watched like season one of lab rats so i don’t know what happened after that. i’m hoping for some of the older disney xd shows too, like zeke and luther or kid vs kat.I\\'d understand adult shows and Movies not being on. I also know that Black Panther Movie will be moved to Netflix after a while. Though, I still think they should add all shows and Movies that they can and give us a reason for the ones they can\\'t.Same. When my teen years were coming to an end I still found Good Luck, Charlie and DWAB super charming.Yes! Lab Rats Elite Force merges the left over Mighty Med and Lab Rats characters into a new show with their shared continuity. It was cool, and sad it got cancelled on a cliffhanger. Disney did them all dirty. Pointless to merge the shows only to drop them with a \"to be continued...\" Poor Kelli Berglund.HDR is not working at all on my Philips pus7304 TV.Worked fine for me. Just watched Toy Story 4 in Dolby Vision and Atmos.From what I\\'ve read the Sony X900F hasn\\'t had Dolby Vision working for a few months now.Really hope they do support ATMOS at some point though!For some reason, I can\\'t get 4k to play on my Disney Plus on Xbox One X. Amazon Prime 4k and Netflix 4k work perfectly.Same boat, at this point I feel like they are just working with Apple so that people get so frustrated that they give up and buy the only product that works reliably with the serviceIf you have a soundbar connected, dolby vision will not work for whatever reason. Ironically, if you disconnect the soundbar and use the tv speakers it will work.&#x200B;People need to start contacting disney+ and notifying them of these issues so they\\'re forced to fix them.I would just get a applet tv 4K, they’ve seem to prioritize that device, all other devices are after thoughts it would seemOn what device though? It\\'s the Android TV version of it that seems buggy.It was working fine not too long ago for me. The thing is the tag for DV is there when I\\'m in the menu for a movie, normally it\\'s not when it\\'s not working so I don\\'t know what\\'s going on. As for Atmos I highly doubt they\\'ll add support, the TV isn\\'t even being supported by Sony anymore so they probably won\\'t even bother adding itI had to go to my Xbox to play in 4K. Of course still no Atmos support on the One X either. This app is a hot mess on anything but Apple products it seemsYeah it\\'s ridiculous. There doesn\\'t seem to be one device that has every feature working properly or supported except for Apple products. My Xbox works for 4K and DV, but doesn\\'t have Atmos support. My TV DID have 4K and DV support, but randomly stopped, and never had Atmos support. I don\\'t get it, what\\'s so hard about just having it work with every device. Netflix works just fine on every device I have, why can\\'t Disney with it\\'s infinite money create a properly working app?I really would rather not have to use a separate device when I have the built in app, but seems like I might not have a choice if I want to experience everything it has to offer rather than features randomly stop working or not even have the features at allMines are LG B9 and Sony X950G. I didn’t try X950G but B9 works fine.No FilmoreBecause they only care about the Movies and modern TV shows.Fun fact: this was one of Sean Connery’s first movies. He was offered the role of James Bond after the producers of the James Bond movies attended a screening of the Darby O’Gill movie.With all the roman coin hoard discoveries these days, it\\'s easy to see how the legend took root.Too bad they ruined it by not having the original audio, but the later redubbing that changed all the voices.I want the Ewok **MOVIES** to be addedMe crying over House of Mouse.Me but with telling them to put Phineas and Ferb in orderThe Ewoks show wasn’t made by Lucasfilm, same with the holiday special. It was an outside 3rd party, hence why it’s not considered canon. Therefore Disney/Lucasfilm don’t own it and why it won’t be on Disney+Why can\\'t they get the episode order right on the shows that they have now?Me about Dave the BarbarianA few things I really want Disney+ to add: \"Paperman\", \"Wander Over Yonder\", and \"Toy Story of Terror\".Think bigger: The Holiday Special lolYES! I loved the Ewoks cartoon, I remember having it on VHS as a kid! I also would really love to see Jungle Cubs and, admittedly, Dave the Barbarian on the service.DuckTales season 2, the muppet show, fraggle rock, etc etcAladdin: THE ANIMATED SERIES!!! Don’t tell me you don’t have it, you have Hercules: The animated series including the crossover with Aladdin episode!!!I just want the Ewok movie!But fr we need Zeke and Luther asapAladdin the Animated Series 😭😭House. Of. Mouse.My mom hates Ewoks. Lmao.Where is my Schnookums & Meat Funny Cartoon Show, you dastardly Disney dinguses?I just want the old zoro series.lmao #deadI have both the Ewoks and Droids cartoons on my Plex server. Got em years ago. They were a pain to find at the time.Me learning there were Ewok movies/specials/shows. Huh.Same except me asking them to actually make Atmos work on my Fire TV that supports it.Need American Dargon Jake LongI want the entire first season of Clone WarsTexas John Slaughter.for me the only time i thought they listened was when i requested the xmen movies and they put them on plus.Muppets show plzMy family and I would request Rolie Polie Olie over and over again if we could.Dog with a Blog 🐶💻PloobThey\\'ll only add stuff that\\'s canon. Holiday Special is unlikely, but more likely than ewoks showBattle For Endor!And upload the full version of the Christmas episode >:(I\\'ve been meaning to catch up on the last whatever number of episodes I haven\\'t seen. Are you saying I can\\'t do that because the episodes are random shuffled or something?The distributor of Star Wars: Ewoks is 20th television, so because of the acquisition of 20th Century Fox, Disney owns it outright. And yes, one of the production companies of that show was Lucasfilm, along with Nelvana, Wang Film Productions, and 20th century television.It’s not considered canon, but that’s not really something that should keep it off the service. The Star Wars LEGO specials aren’t canon either and Disney doesn’t seem to only want to include things from the MCU under the marvel brand.They could simply have a Star Wars Legends section in the Star Wars brand of the service.Life Day is in Mandalorian and therefore Holiday Special is canon! Favreau and Filoni have spoken.Damn it dude, look at the pain on this person’s proxy’s face. You could let them down a little more gently and at least give them some hope.According to [this](https://m.imdb.com/news/ni62812894?ref_=m_tt_nwr_1) its now canon.Right? Good Lord. Do your job, techs.Season 2 is on there.Fraggle Rock was a CBC+HBO show, so I doubt Disney+ has any rights for it. The Disney channel did show it for sometime, but that just means they licensed it for that time frame.Edit: Seems The Jim Henson Company seems to own the media rights. Sony most recently licensed it for BluRay. No mention of streaming rights.THEY DON\\'T HAVE THE FULL VERSION?  WHY WOULD THEY NOT HAVE THE FULL EPISODE?I\\'M \\\\*H E A T E D\\\\*Yeah it\\'s not in order at all.  I think the last few episodes are in order, but that\\'s about it.  Other than that it\\'s EXTREMELY out of order.  They didn\\'t even get the first episode rightEVERYBODY KNOWS THE FIRST EPISODE IS THE ROLLERCOASTER EPISODEBut I\\'ve been complaining almost daily for months for them to fix it.  I think I\\'ve made progress, unless they\\'re just lying to me to make me feel betterActually, the Lego specials on Disney+ are considered canon adjacent. Lucasfilm has spoken about that numerous times. Basically everything on Disney+ in the Star Wars hub is canon. I’m not against the Ewoks stuff coming at all though should they choose to add it!Also mala and lumpy are canonThat’s like saying Luke Skywalker is canon so every book with Luke Skywalker in it is canon.That article is also false.Of the 2017 one?Last time I watched it was shortened. They cut out the entire song “Danville is very nice” and other scenes.Yeah that\\'s all I\\'ve got from their support. Most likely not a fault of the reps themselves, more to do with the info and power they\\'re given. I\\'ve asked them about Atmos support on my recent generation Fire TV a couple  times and they never seem to understand what it means.What does canon adjacent mean? Just that they have to follow the canon?Oh I wasn’t aware of that. Gonna look into that right now. But yeah I do feel there should be a Star Wars legends section at least for those people who enjoyed the older stories.Yup! It was added last week.But... but that song goes hard... why, Disney, why?!Hold up lemme check if that song is on there nowOkay so I just checked and the song is in thereWhich season is that?  Also if you know, what\\'s the episode title?Never mind I found itWell tbf I don\\'t know what that means lolWait is Atmos that surround sound type thing that newer phones have nowadays?I\\'m not certain, but my guess is that it\\'s canon until proven otherwiseIt’s canon and it happens unless in the off chance it contradicts anything .I think it’s that the rough plot and the events are canon but it’s told in a child friendly way. Like the battle droid is 100% canon from the show since he’s in one of the canon books. The family is also 100% canon but beyond existing it’s hard to say how much.Oh sweet! In all regions too? Cuz I’m out of the US.It skips most of it for me. Only like the first 10 seconds and then it skips to the very end.Atmos and DTS-X are ways to mix surround sound such that the mixer tells the software what directions certain sounds are supposed to come from and it scales based on the end user speaker setup.A typical Atmos setup also requires overhead speakers.I am especially excited to get it because D+ should be the only service that can make it accessible to me right now on my new speaker setup that bounces sound off the ceiling to simulate the overhead speakers and I\\'ve never got to try it.But yeah they\\'re also using the \"Atmos\" brand to describe other things like sophisticated(?) methods to simulate surround sound on phones and laptops. IMO that dilutes a good brand that they\\'ve got.I would recommend finding a nearby movie theater with Atmos screens and checking it out! Though, the experience really depends on the movies and the quality of sound mixing in them.I don\\'t know about that. SorrySo it\\'s on DailyMotion and it\\'s about 39 minutes long... huhOh yeah it was pretty short for me, guess I just didn\\'t notice.  That\\'s sad.  For me it said the episode is twenty minutes long, I\\'ll go check the official length of itWack#20BucksForOnwardGet it trending.I would love if they put it on iTunes for $20 rental, but offered it as a $10 rental within Disney+.I saw Onward in theatres 2 days before they got closed in my country. In my opinion, it\\'s one of Pixar\\'s best.I loved Onward. I think they really should just add Onward, Maleficent 2 (it came before Frozen 2, should have been included) and Star Wars Rise of Skywalker this week. It will cost them money, but it would promote goodwill and help cover bad press from kicking out the Disney College Program kids. They can even re-release Onward later this year or something. I wouldn\\'t want that to be a habit, but these are very different times.... Hell, throw in Artemis Fowl and then give that release date to Mulan.All movie theaters in Canada are shutting down it looks like. Our biggest chain closed today. Would love to see this even on demand...Man I’m so angry i wanted to go last weekend withMy nephews to go watch it, but one of them didn’t finish their homework so no dice. Now I know I won’t get to see it in theaters.I’m with you - would love to see itSo sad how Onward has performed at the box office.  I loved the movie so much.  It’s a bummer people didn’t go out and support an original movie idea.  This is how you get nothing but sequels.   Maybe they can get creative and find a way to still make money from it.All movie theathers in Norway closed last thursday, the same day I was gonna see the movie. I guess I will have to wait until Disney+ comes to Norway this summer.They\\'ll sell it, like with SW Ep 9. It won\\'t be added for \\'free\\' immediatelyOnward was great, and even after seeing it in theaters, I will gladly pay to watch it again.Universal is already doing it with three of it\\'s movies. I wouldn\\'t be surprised if other production companies follow suit.They won’t add it to Disney+. They’ll look at what Universal is doing and if they are making dough, Disney will follow suit and put it on demand.Family saw it last week on a Disney Cruise. It was really good.r/ChoosingBeggars threadMate do u feel vindicatedClosed in Ohio!If they don’t push it, well, *onward* to streaming then they should rerelease it in theaters in the summer.I’d think it’s very realistic they’d offer it up shortly for digital rent.I know we’d pay $20 to see it. Well reviewed and a victim of circumstance. They spent money marketing it and a re-release just wouldn’t make sense because the timing would be so impossible to predict.It made $102 million so it’s certainly not an all time bust. They’d own the rental space for 2 weeks even at a high $20 price point.  They’d need 5 million households to rent it for another $100 million. That seems plausible considering there are limited other forms of entertainment right now, and new content will become rare as this drags on.I was lucky enough to get tickets to the advanced screening and absolutely loved it. I need it to come to Disney+ soon so I can have a good cry again lolI agree.  I watched it last week Tuesday and I literally had an entire IMAX screen to myself.  I wish I was exaggerating but the fear of the virus has really impacted its BO returns and I could absolutely see Disney releasing it on VOD early if not taking it straight to Disney+.  It would be further incentive for those with kids to subscribe to the service if those parents see Disney making a habit of \"quick turnarounds\".I MANIFESTED THIS!!!🙌🏼🙌🏼Thank you Disney! 😘🥰You won’t be missing much. Saw it last weekend, though it’s good, it’s far from Pixar’s best.I don\\'t believe Disney+ apps have the ability to charge rentals. If so it would be there by now. Only way its going to happen is through itunes or amazon or google rentals.It\\'ll be on D+ eventually. Just have patienceThe only thing I\\'d pay $20 to rent is the Lord and Miller cut of Solo.Why would you say that!? Now we have to watch it! 😭They only added Frozen because of how much nad press they got for kicking all the college program kids outI think a large part of why it didn\\'t do well is because of the virus starting to spread here in the US so people kinda kept away.  It was way to close to release to stop it at that point and Disney used it as a test since it didn\\'t do well they postponed the next few movies.  I\\'m surprised at how long they waited to push Mulan since that is a film that needs to do well in China to succeed and theatres in China have been closed for awhile.They are adding OnwardThey are!Boy do I have news for youDisney Cruise? YikesDamn 😂😂😂 r/winningchoosingbeggarsBetter than The Good Dinosaur, I hope?I’m saying they could add that feature. It’s still a new service.Your wish is my command 😌Just saw, on april 3Nah, it was perfect. A bubble of safety floating along in the ocean. If you\\'ve never been on a disney cruise I was extremely impressed with the sanitation and cleanliness of the entire ship and how seriously the crew took it. Way safer than being in the parks.It’s much better than The Good Dinosaur. Maybe because I grew up close with brother, I found it pretty emotional too.about the sameI don\\'t recall ever watching the good dinosaur to be honest.I hope they don\\'t but only because I like to log in to a streaming service and then be able to click onto anything for \"free\". It\\'s heartbreaking when someone first goes on Amazon Prime video and goes \"oh, let\\'s watch that\", thinking it\\'s free, and then finding out it\\'s very much not. But I certainly see your point! Maybe a separate chunk of the app that is completely distinct from the normal Disney Plus bit.I\\'ve watched it and I also don\\'t recall it.Don’tI believe they said Futurama is too \"vulgar and violent\" which I find unjustified since Simpsons is on there too. I agree though they should put it on D+.The complete run of Futurama is currently available on Hulu in the US, but it may never go onto Disney+ as it\\'s aimed for an older audiences (but i\\'m not sure if it\\'s available for streaming anywhere in Australia)There is no way Futurama will ever be on D+Go to huluIt is available, HuluAs a big fan of both shows:There was definitely a turn in subject matter and violence when the show moved to Comedy Central. Future a became quite a bit more adult, as if it ever wasn’t.The Simpsons is, for the most part, a lot more child friendly. Some of the worst things that happen on the Simpsons are regular subject matter on the Simpsons.Two very different shows.“I’m from Australia”“Go to a US only streaming service”Hulu isn’t available in Australia.Didn\\'t realize it was us only sorry :(It’s also on Netflix, I think that is in Australia.It’s also on NetflixFuturama isn’t on the Australian netflix. Unfortunately the only option for OP to watch it digitally is four episodes on 7Plus, catching random episodes on Fox8, or buying the show on iTunes.It’s not on Netflix in Australia.The video they posted at the beginning of the month said it would come March 29. So maybe then...I was wondering the same thing.It\\'s there now.US subscriber here.  BH6 season 2 showed up as of 3/29/2020.Look again ;) They\\'re slow, but it\\'s better than just leaving it off entirely like Three on The Run, Zorro season 1, Wicked Tuna Outer Banks, and Wicked Tuna season 3-7... all of which were to have been added last week or the week before.It\\'s there now.No it isn\\'t bro. I just checked.What country are you from? Maybe it depends.Awesome :)! I just checked and we have it as well. Thank you for the heads up :).What about UkIt’s not there for me yet (Canada) but at least they’re putting it up somewhere :)!Oh sorry Yes it is up in America! Edit: oh gosh I\\'m so sorry! I was looking at their big hero 6 shorts which does have season 2. Apparently they\\'re adding it later this monthNo it isn\\'t. I just checked.Just out of curiosity, what device are you watching this on? It\\'s not showing as Atmos on my Xbox One S.Firestick 4k and Nvidia Shield support Atmos on D+.Can I get a refund, since I just bought the damn thing? LolBring atmos support to xbox one!The only device I can get atmos to work on is Apple TV 4K. I have a fire tv 4K, Xbox one x, roku tcl tv, and Vizio UHD tv with a Dolby atmos soundbar connected to each tv. Only Apple TV I’ve gotten atmos from the Xbox forces atmos but the icon isn’t shown in the menu like on the Apple TVHaven’t been able to get fire stick 4K to work via arc with atmos, does it only work with plugging directly into receiver?I\\'ll be getting the Nvidia Shield Pro as soon as I can find one. That\\'s gotta do better than the XboxIt may be HDR.  On my TV, all skin tones were super red.After I adjusted it, it was amazing.  I never realized how much of a red tint it had but afterward, it looks more blue and green even when it\\'s not HDR, but it really exaggerates incorrect settings.Oooh, I bet I need a 4k firestick. My smart tv has an amazon fire os, but it\\'s not a 4k tv... and apparently non-4k firesticks aren\\'t compatible. that\\'s got to be the reason.Download disruption can only mean one thing. Invasion.Are youg Getting the same error code 66 as that guy yesterday?No error code. Just no download buttonYes. Happens everytimeDo you press RB/LB to rewind or the thumb sticks?I can’t get anything to play at allNo, we have an Xbox media remote. Does using the actual controller work???Yes it doesNo big surprise. Sky would take them to the cleaners.thats good as Disney Plus is my birthday treat for myself this yearI also hate that they won\\'t answer my question on why some shows can\\'t be on UK Disney+.They can’t? Of course they can... they just don’t want to.[removed]It’s probably as simple as who owns the distribution rightsWhy on earth would they not want to?I doubt it.Money?They lose money by not participating in the biggest boost the streamingindustry has ever had.They want to, they just cantWhat i argue by “can/can’t” is the usual difference you were taught in middle school “Teacher, can I go to the bathroom? - You can, buy you might not”. There is no “can’t” in situations like this, where you just need to tell your IT what to do.First of all, I am not sure it is about IT.There are questions which have to be answered about the Server thats provides the Service! Is it inhouse? Maybe it runs at AWS and they cant make it go faster.There are questions to be asked about the country. Websites of this size have to be registered for a special day many months in advance. They cant just change it!And about the special deffinition of can/can\\'t. I am not from the UK, but I know how Servers and Websites work. I did not learn the special deffinition of can/can\\'t in middleschool.Not everyone on an international website is from your country :)I’m Italian, I’m not in UK either.I know IT stuff too, I’m a developer. Plus, I also pre-ordered (and paid!) the one-year subscription, so everything is already set in place from a simple technical point of view. It’s just a business decision, that’s it...Wait what???That you preordered and paid has nothing to do with the fact that they cant start earlier... And that you assume it does kinda makes me wonder what kind of IT-Knowledge you have.And this is a problem not only about IT, but also about Economics as well as the regulations of each country. You would have to study business-informatics to know about that. There you study law/economics and informatics all in one... Just because you can cover one part of knowledge, doesnt mean you covered them all, to add to that, I am concerned to what extend you cover the needed IT-Knowledge...So you genuinely think that a billion-dollars company doesn’t have everything set in place at a week from their worldwide launch, considering that their service have been running for three months in three different countries? How naive.I believe they have everything set!!!I just dont believe they are allowed to start. Imagine your a formula 1 driver. You and your car are set to drive. You still cant until the freaking light goes out. Thats how regulations work! You cant just do something days before you said you will do it, just because you want because the goverment will not freaking allow it!And that you think they can just kinda shows that you are the naive one here.Probably the option will be added soon[deleted]Oh, I\\'m really sorry, didn\\'t look it up as I was pretty sure it was made by them.The Lion King, Captain Marvel and The Last Jedi also have commentaries. Hocus Pocus has a trivia mode which features commentary, behind the scenes info etc. as you watch the movie.The jon favreau lion king has commentaryThanks. And the Simpsons Movie.same bruhA day later is was fixed for meLemme checkEpisode 9 isn’t on Disney+ for the US, we don’t even know when we would get it.Probably about may or June they’ll release it on Disney plus they’ll want to make money off the digital release before they put it onto Disney plus[deleted]Rumoured release date on disney+ was July I believe. Don\\'t remember the source so take it with a grain of salt. Not sure which region either.Best case Scenario: sometime between March 21st and April 3rd (Probably the 30th for Europe and 31st for America).Worst Case Scenario: Next Year (It isn\\'t in the slate I read). https://www.google.com/amp/s/collider.com/upcoming-disney-plus-movies-release-dates/%3fampI’m betting it drops in just a few weeks in the US, if not sooner. Frozen 2 had just a 30 day window before the decision was made to release it early and as the curve for the Coronavirus is unable to be flattened, Disney will look to replace the loss in physical media sales of SWROS with an increase in Disney+ subscribers.I even think Black Widow will have to bypass a theatrical release when it becomes apparent theaters will remain closed well past its scheduled release date in April and go directly to Disney+ rather than VOD and/or rescheduling its release in 2021.Frozen 2 hit Disney+ less than three weeks after the DVD/blu-ray release. If Covid-19 keeps disrupting things the way it has been, I could definitely see them doing something similar for Rise of Skywalker. With Rise of Skywalker releasing physically on March 31st, I could see it hitting Disney+ in mid to late April.I can’t see them releasing TROS on D+ before physical media release. It will probably be a shorter window, but I still expect it to be at least a couple weeks if not the 30 day window of Frozen 2. There is no way movies like Black Widow or Mulan will skip theatrical release to go straight to BluRay/streaming. Even delayed they will still make money at the box office when they are eventually able to be released. Frozen 2 already made its box office money and a good portion of its home release sales that putting it up on D+ early is not that big of deal to their bottom line.They are dropping Onward before it. We will get Star Wars September or later (I read we will get it september). Idk what source said the date.They are putting Onward on there, so I don\\'t think so.I definitely can see them possibly dropping SWROS the same day as the physical media is scheduled to be released which would still keep that digital exclusive window for the VOD services. At least where I am, restrictions are in place for people only to shop for essential needs. TBH... the targets and Walmart’s by me are so understaffed and overworked that I wouldn’t be shocked if the Blu-ray display and copies are even put out and sadly any one who is leaving their home and going to the store just for a copy of Star Wars is endangering others and not helping to flatten the curve of the virus. Disney knows this which is why they might try to discourage folks from shopping just for Star Wars and dropping it on Disney+ on that date.Black Widow and Mulan... I agree under current circumstances, but we have no idea what the country is going to be like in a few months let alone a few weeks. I would never shut the door on the possibility as remote as it seems today.Onward is a weird case though. It was released in theaters just before everything went crazy. At least here in the States. So they\\'re releasing it for purchase today in the hopes of recouping some of their losses and then dropping it on Disney+ on April 3rd.Onward just puts the release dates on Disney + out of order. You would think it would be Theatrical order, but I guess not. I think at this rate, we will get Mulan 2020 and Soul before TRoS.That would make no sense. Rise of Skywalker already had it\\'s theatrical run and is going to have more or less a normal release for home video and streaming. Might hit Disney+ a bit early like Frozen 2 did. Mulan and Soul are going to get a normal theatrical release after all of this craziness passes. Unless Universal\\'s new release schedule makes them a decent amount of money and Disney decides to follow their lead and release them for purchase.no frozen fever?just give me back The Simpsons collections please! no idea why they took it away so quickLego is awesome but hey are there so many animated Lego shorts? I feel like they’re half of the Disney+ libraryAye I was expecting this to come. Weird they left one of the frozen shorts out though.Checked earlier today. Frozen 2 still not available in Canada. Not that I’m complainingWonder why Frozen II is not in 4K?No Frozen 2 in Canada.Olaf\\'s Frozen Adventure was adorable. Worth a watch.It\\'s odd they didn\\'t put Frozen 2 up in 4k HDR. It\\'s the only new disney movie they didn\\'t do that with.Am I the only one that feels like the collections are getting a little crazy? I guess it can be nice to have, but for properties with fewer titles, like Frozen or Pirates of the Caribbean, it seems a little silly to a have a whole collection page dedicated to 3 or 4 things.AKA \"When Hell Freezes Over\"It says the 17/03/2020 NZ release date but is that American time or NZ time cos if it is we\\'re waiting until tomorrow lolAbout as pointless as the Darth Vader collectionDefine “collection”I don’t believe 3 items count as a collection. I understand it’s a marketing use but it’s kind of obvious that’s all these are forAdvertising? For free?It\\'s on Netflix as part of a Disney Shorts compilation.It\\'ll probably come back when the updated aspect ratio launches :DWhat are you talking about? All of the Simpsons episodes are still on Disney +...The Star Wars ones need to be consolidated so badlyYeah, just put everything in a Lego collection.Tuesday according to Disney+’s twitterI think you guys have to wait a little bit more for itTuesdayFun fact: Kate Anderson who did some of the songs for Olaf’s Frozen Adventure is the little sister of Kristen Anderson-Lopez who did the songs for Frozen/Frozen 2.It\\'s supposed to be up tomorrow, it took a bit more time to finish testing the film is what I heard.Right? There\\'s 4 titles in this \"collection\" hahaIt’s 4*It’s a subreddit devoted to Disney plus...I’m pretty sure we don’t need to be sold on the benefits of Disney pluswhile i admire your optimism i’m starting to worry we won’t get either for a whileHe meant the collections, like categories “Halloween” “holiday” etcWhat about the Micheal Jackson one?Yes!! Why are LEGO Star Wars stuff listed with official Star Wars tv series?? They need to clear out all of that noise...Oh that\\'s good! When I looked earlier I think it still said June lolOh... great... can’t wait... yay 😒I don’t mind at all. My daughter on the other hand ...Still wouldn’t use the term collection. I would use something like lineup or series or something more like that. Collection indicates more of a larger and grander amount of content rather than two movies and a couple shorts.For instance, a trilogy is not a collection. It’s simply a trilogy of movies. While a long line of movies such as the james bond ones would be considered a collection as there are quite a bit of them at this point.Going back to trilogies, alone Star Wars has an isolated three trilogies but together they make one story regardless of how people feel about it. It still makes a large collection of films. In addition, the tv shows that are a part of that story can be amassed into the “collection” as it were because it ties into that very story.So again, a couple movies and two shorts don’t really qualify in the same vein regardless of how well received the movies are. The shorts barely qualify as one is contained in a separate collection of shorts itself and the other while long is still just a short.Just my opinion but the way I see it, the way they’re using the term is no more than a marketing move to advertise new movies on the front page. If there wasn’t any others to out it in with, they’d associate the movie with others like it to make a “collection” which circles back to my point about it being no more than a way to advertise.Ah ok, I never knew that was a thing. He panicked me for a second, I had to check to make sure they hadn\\'t pulled all the episodes lolI’m pretty sure Groening once said that was a dead and buried episode in light of the Jackson allegations. I remember my friend running out to buy that season before it was removed from future sets.I remember reading that as well.Yah it still says June on the app, but the twitter confirmed it would be Tuesday!Dude let it goIt’s on mine :).WOOPS. I am so sorry, allow me to correct myself. I only had access to WT: Outer Banks. The series itself never showed up. But Outer Banks is there. Unplayable with no scheduled release date... so I don’t even know why the heck it’s on the service. I should’ve taken a screenshot of it this morning.Still only have seasons 1-2 here. Which country?That’s exactly what happened on mine!! So confusing and unclear. It was supposed to be available on Friday the 13thNo worries. It’s on my phone app too. At least this must mean it’s coming soonCanada but I can’t even see it now. I could @ 6 this morning. It used to have the drop down season menu on mobile but now it’s basically just a picture, a summary, and that’s it. I can add it to my watchlist but that doesn’t work in actuality. Sorry :( I have no idea what’s going on.Yeah I’m not sure what’s going on. Some of the content that was supposed to be there today (like the second season of BH6 the series) is nowhere to be found. I wish they’d issue an official release schedule and stick to it.True. It’d just be nice if it would happen during... oh, I don’t know... a nationwide self quarantine :)It\\'ll be out at 8pm New Zealand time so whatever time that is in Aussie. Its that way with all releasesNot available for me eitherMe neither :(Thanks - should only be about an hour away then!I\\'m in Canada and we dont have it eitherAnything yet?Yes! Appeared at around 6pm Australian Eastern timeDisney MIGHT offer a $20 VOD rental like Universal on SOME films. Onward would be a good candidate because it’s already been released and will now stagnate at the box office due to theater closings. But they’re not going to take major tent pole films like Mulan and Black Widow and go that route. They’ll just shelve them for a few months and release when people are desperate to get out of the house after being cooped up.I think it would be best to do that with Artemis Fowl, because it’s not as anticipated as other movies.LolYou do understand that these online petitions are only as good as the paper they are printed on, right?If you want to watch it on a tiny screen, you are free to wait until they do put it on a VOD or subscription service. But there are a lot of people that want to watch it on the big screen first, and experience it the way it was made to be experienced.They’ll put it on VOD before D+I wouldn\\'t sign this myself because that would be a horrible precedent and would cause a neverending cascade of issues related to taking two of the biggest \"woman-led\" films in history and not giving them a proper theatrical release. No thanks. I\\'d rather see them in theatres July / August replacing Free Guy and Artemis Fowl.4chan rumors are saying if they decide to go the VOD route it’s $39.99 for a 24 hour rental based on ads that an agency was working on. The other two ads being worked on were for a November 6th, 2020 release (replacing Eternals) or a Disney+ exclusive release bypassing the traditional VOD vendors. Obviously, anything from 4chan has to be taken with a grain of salt. November 6th seems like the most plausible possibility of the three.Artemis Fowl and The New Mutants could definitely get that treatment.There are a lot of ppl who can\\'t go to the theater and have to wait til it\\'s released on VOD. Diasbled and Parents w/ small kids can\\'t just decide to go. Myself being disabled, can no longer go to a theater cause I have no vehicle capable to get in w/ my powerchair, and living in a small town, the closest theater is 30miles away. Whats wrong with having these movies put out on VOD? Cause than ppl like myself can finally not worry about having a surprise spoiled, and we can actually talk w/ friends who saw it. This movie season is alrdy ruined, why not just let us watch while we are stuck at home. I\\'m sure most company\\'s have alrdy wrote this movie season as a bust. Imagine how many subs they would add by adding a new Theatrical movie every couple weeks.Either one would be fine, but they should follow universals direction during the pandemic. Delaying films will only cause a domino effectIf you\\'re a Disney fan OR a cinema fan and if you value you other people\\'s careers, you shouldn\\'t root for the company to lose billions of dollars. Losing a theatrical window is a tremendously bad situation for both Disney and the theatre industry.Black Widow taking so long to come out with a film has a been a major talking point in the industry for years. Putting it straight to home release would be baaaaad. Anyone who follows industry discourse knows how important female-led franchises have been over the past few years. Sending the two biggest ones of the year to a streaming service without a proper release would be incredibly harmful.I like gratification too, but explaining my reason for not signing the petition is not something to downvote me over. This subreddit doesn\\'t seem to understand what downvotes are for. They\\'re for people who don\\'t add to the discussion or are offensive. Providing a dissenting opinion is part of a healthy discussion.&#x200B;Films that should be added to streaming sooner are Onward, as it has lost most of it\\'s theatrical window and has already completed its marketing, and Maleficent 2 which has already been released on Blu Ray.Damn I don’t think I’d go for forty, if I was able to have people over to chip in or a small party but not during corona. Now if they offer me a movies anywhere digital copy in that package when it releases to buy digital then I’d be in but I’d never pay 40 bucks just to rent a movie on my tv for just myself.$40 works for my family of five. Our start time and concessions plus new movie seems reasonable. It\\'s high for single user but these are off nominal times.Christ. I\\'m a solo viewer and would only pay that if it came with a blu-ray shipped to me at a later stage. That\\'s cheap for a whole family, but a real slap in the face for a single person who doesn\\'t password share and is isolated due to coronavirus / whatever.New Mutants has been delayed so many times, they should just drop it on VOD or D+ alrdy. I believe it\\'s very 1st release date was for Feb 2018, than delayed til 2019, than they decided to add a new char and reworked the story and added the scenes of the new char.What\\'s wrong is that the movie companies that make these movies won\\'t be making the money they normally do, and that will result in not as many movies being released. You do understand that they release movies as they do for a reason, not just because \"it\\'s how it\\'s always been done\". They make the most money from theater releases. Why would they want to give that up? Would be be willing to give up a majority of your revenue you get (other than taxes) just because a bunch of people ask you to?What kind of domino effect?Disney could also put Call of the Wild on VOD as well as Underwater.All the other films being delayed. But I wouldn\\'t  care. if the first half of 2021 is just films that were supposed to be latter half of this year it wouldn\\'t end the world. Things would  catch up eventually...i’ve been wondering tooFor what it\\'s worth, they removed Wicked Tuna and Wicked Tuna Outer Banks from Hulu! And they added a placeholder for Outer Banks. It\\'s clear they\\'re continuing to have trouble with the service but that those things should be coming soon since they wouldn\\'t have removed them from Hulu otherwise.I\\'m more interested in what the hell happened to Zorro season 1...and we are still waiting...maybe Disney doesn\\'t know there is problemThat’s so weird!Check your sound cables. This can happen when it’s loose or not getting a full connection. Other than that power cycle your deviceAre you playing through a stereo with a center channel? Check the wiring on that speaker.Probably not any cases outside of the quarantine (Mulan cost a *lot* of money) but Rise of Skywalker could come early to the service like Frozen 2 did. This is also probably the only way to salvage Onward\\'s viewership.They are trying to salvage what they can for releases that they deem would be hurt by delays/cancellations. All US movie theaters will be forced to close within another week or two for at least 30-60 days at a minimum. For F&F, it’s such a huge movie that delaying a full year won’t hurt it, but for a movie like Trolls which already has licensed Toys on the shelves, the toys will grow stale with in a few months and when the movie eventually was released, would have lost all momentum.Yes, some industry insiders are saying it’s a ballsy move to obliterate the theater release window, I’m in the opinion that there will be no release window since movie theaters will be shut down by the time its release in early April.They’ll, wisely, wait and see if it’s successful or if it greatly hurts their revenue. This isn’t a precedent.  It’s a test.  If it succeeds then it’s a precedent. If it fails, it never happened again. Based on The Interview, I’m predicting the latter.I could see Rise of Skywalker coming early, like Frozen II and Onward are, but they\\'re not going to send one of their billion dollar franchises straight to streaming, not yet anyway.I could see them sending something like New Mutants straight to streaming as a sort of test balloonThey don\\'t have anything big coming out right now. (As far as I know)New Mutants could go to Disney PlusIt’s not really a test. It’s salvaging the movie period. Trolls is a movie that depends greatly on its merchandising. Lego already released the sets. The dolls are already on the shelves. Clothes, etc already in stores. Theaters will be closed nationwide within a few days for at least 30-60 days. Trolls is not a movie like F&F that can survive a 1 year delay when all of its merchandise is already in stores.Black Widow and Mulan have release dates that will probably occur during the time when movie theaters are still closed down.I feel like New Mutants is a little outside of the family friendly vibe Disney is going for with their releases on Disney+. If they were to release it on a streaming service, it would probably be Hulu. I feel like they would be more likely to release it on VOD instead though. That way they could at least try to make some of their money back on it.Black Widow is a month away (most recommendations put isolation at two weeks) and Mulan was delayed.But it’s a pg 13 which is allowed and in other countries other than USA the x men Fox catalogue is on there and new mutants is the same rating as the other x men films (excluding logan and deadpool) and no one else has Hulu other than USA hence why there in Disney PlusBarring a miraculous turnaround, movie theaters across the nation will be closed in April. Almost every major health care network that operates hospitals are telling employees that the worst is still weeks away as they prepare. They are in the process of setting up tents in the parking lots of Philadelphia area hospitals to test and treat once the virus really hits. What we are seeing now is still just the infancy and to be prepared to be overwhelmed in the coming weeks.It\\'s not just about rating though. New Mutants is a horror movie. And the director has established they they do really push the boundaries of that PG-13 rating.That’s true but different countries like UK Australia and New Zeland will put it on there maybe not in USA but this is the thing with D+ is the regional differences and its within the rating so I could see it on here in different countries as again we don’t have hulu and they put all the fox x men other than the 18 rating ones and new mutants in uk is a 12 so it will be its how different countries deal with the content and ratingsinto the unknownr/glitchinthematrix ?Apple TV because of Siri. I just say “play The Simpsons season 5 episode 5” and I’m watching that episode within 15 seconds. If you don’t have one I recommend getting one.The PS4 app still has issues. Nearly every time I try to watch something I get an error, usually \"No Internet Connection\" or the generic \"Unable to Connect\". Everything else works fine on my console.I absolutely love my fire stick. It’s so fast and 4K. Plus the remote has voice control.The D+ app isn’t on the App Store yet for my Samsung TV - will it release next week?Apple TV is just a good choice period for streaming.I\\'ll take a look later today and seeDidn’t they have DOBLY VISION?It technically did have Dolby Vision, but the picture, to my eyes, was anything but. And some scenes were so monotone gray that I could barely tell what was happening. But now I watch it and I think they’ve fixed the HDR and Dolby Vision because everything looks so much better.Hmmm! I’ll have to check it out. Thanks for sharing that! Cuz I watched all of the episodes and it was in Dolby Vision. Yeah they look a bit terrible but I watched them all. I guess I’ll watch them again.Yes.  We watch it on our Fire Stick (2 different ones) and we\\'ve been having A LOT of buffering, pausing.  The only explanation I could come up with is that so many more people and home and watching that their servers can\\'t handle it.  I also don\\'t know how much buffering there is on a Fire Stick.Same here on my Firestick, Firetv and Kindle Fire. Works fine on iPhone and AppleTv on same networkAlways am. Works on my amazon tv about half the timeWatched Frozen II on my Roku Express yesterday and it was fine.  It\\'s only the 3rd movie I\\'ve watched though. I did watch all of Mandalorian and The Clone Wars series.I have also issues, just when a mouvie is starting buffering i get an error. It is often fixed with browser restartStill haven’t been able to even see the queue of movies/shows. HorribleI’m getting the same. Poor frame rate and buffering times. I figured overloaded servers also.Well that\\'s fantastic and saves me money (though only £2. A bit annoying it\\'s for new customers only)ProbablyIt’s out already today for me in the USAI’ll thank Disney in two days - Canada.Hope your kid feels better soon.What a pleasant surprise. It was available yesterday and seemed to be some trouble with the servers. Kids have been transfixed for over an hour.  This is awesome.I hope your kid will do well. I am sick too. So I feel him.I just watched it, I\\'m so happy it\\'s up early. I didnt see it in theaters.Super neat, but dang. I just bought it a week ago because I didn\\'t expect it to be available soon. Oh well.Seconded. Also, Stargirl was great.Hope the little one feels better soon.We watched Frozen II today as well. Enjoyed the movie!I hope you\\'re sick kid is feeling better soon. We were supposed to watch Frozen 2 as a family tonight because I\\'ve been working.  Only our 19 and 17 year old daughters have seen it...our 11 year old son and 5 year old daughter, my husband and myself haven\\'t watched it.Guess what was on TV this morning and what our younger two were watching as I was heading to the kitchen for coffee?  Frozen 2. 🤦I just watched it for the first time today since I didn\\'t see it in theaters. I was shocked at how much I enjoyed it. Over all, Frozen as a whole had become so overdone. But today when I watched I saw something different. I related to it in a while new way and was even inspired by it. I\\'m often inspired by Disney but...I dunno, there was something about this one. Maybe just right place right time ¯\\\\_(ツ)_/¯Watching it with my kiddos right now!It says june 26 for canada!I don’t want to sound greedy but I’d be super thankful for the latest Starwars.Hopefully your kid feels better soonSick kid? Oh no.Thanks for frozen 2 but let me be able to remove devices pleaseThank you Disney!❤In the Netherlands its still on the 10th of july :(Disney, I am in Spain please bring the service start forward from the 24th to ASAP!Frozen 2 is cool and all but Disney don’t got Star Wars Episode 9 bruhI don’t get the hype about it. Everyone said it was so much better than frozen 1, just watched it and we were all pretty disappointed with it. It stunkWe watched it for the first time last night and I didn\\'t like it at all. Really enjoyed Frozen but this one was just missing somethingEdit: oh that\\'s right, it\\'s reddit. I\\'m not allowed to have a different opinionThank you but please fix the app. Crashes every five seconds trying to rewind or something.I\\'ll thank Disney in nine - UK.Why in two days?[removed]Same, I’ve seen the first one, thought it was completely fine so I gave this one a shot. Like it basically the same as the first one although the animation in this one is beautifulThat’s how I feel about Star Wars: TROS I want to buy it for prime rn but I’m wondering if I should wait till it’s on Disney+It’s a placeholder. Disney has already announced it’s coming on Tuesday.They actually released that early on digital.  Might’ve been too much to ask to release it on Disney+ so soon, but you can buy it from most digital sources like iTunes.Really?  I mean, the plot was meandering but not bad.  But the songs were definitely better except the Chicago rip-off song, which didn\\'t fit.Def not as good as the first, I agree. A few of the songs were catchy but definitely not all of them. It was just okay for me.I’m on it.What’s disney? - AtlantisI\\'ll thank Disney in 9 days too - Italy.I presume its because Disney isn\\'t releasing Frozen 2 in Canada until 2 days from nowYeah as much as all of us want it, the DVD/Blu Ray sales would tank if Disney+ got itYeah I just felt parts of it were too drawn out. I found myself bored, especially during many of the songs. It definitely wasn\\'t the worst movie I\\'ve ever seen, it just didn\\'t live up to the hype.Hope your kid feels better soon! Stay safe!That\\'s the thanks you give for naming a movie after you?How you doing over there?Disney plus wasn\\'t released in all over the world in the same time. In most of the Europe it will be released in march for example.I’m in Canada, it says Frozen 2 will be available June 2020?Yeah and it def seemed like a lot of unnecessary songs at some parts. like Olaf’s song when the Forest was messing with him. I’m like this is odd haha. I did however love Kristoff’s reo-speedwagon-like, boy band moment. That gave me a good chuckle lolThanks for asking.It\\'s not an easy situation. Most of us are in their own homes, confined and away from every possible contact  with other people. It\\'s tough when you can\\'t leave your house or see your loved ones, your friends or just going to the gym where you can have a social encounters, just for a few minutes. It\\'s not safe to leave your house, and we have the responsibility to protect ourselves and the people that are at risk of dying from the virus. The north of Italy is lucky to be one of the places that has the best health facility in the world, but they have already the hospitals full of people. Now we reached the point where the doctors don\\'t have enough resources for everyone and they are forced to let people die, choosing who can live. It\\'s horrible and that\\'s happening in the part of the country with the most organized and more rich health structures. We are lucky that everything is free and people are not letting to die without any hope, but in the south the situation is tougher and we are trying to manage the situation the best we could.The doctors are exhausted, photo of them sleeping in the hospitals, tired and overwhelmed by the situation are spreading.I\\'m personally lucky because I work from home, but a lot of people cannot, and that also makes the situation more difficult to manage, Italy doesn\\'t have the strongest economy in the world and in particular the south is pretty behind in terms of financial security. As you can imagine, a lot of family are struggling without an income and the govern are making debts upon debts to help the people as much as possibile. But probably it will be not enough and darker times are yet to come.Everyone are staying at home, knowing is the best bet to fight the virus and at least allowing the hospitals delaying the spread of the virus. That is particularly important, because this way the number of people affected by the virus and in need of help are distributed and all the people needs assistance at the same time, allowing hospitals to reorganize their resources.The funny side is that people are doing their best to make the situation less heavy. Every day at different hours, someone choose a song and at max volume it will be blasted outside the window, this way all the neighborhood can listed together the same song and dance and sing. It\\'s pretty fun.And the list is long, the situation hard. I\\'m scared for my father, for the economic situation that will be a problem on the medium/long run, and that I cannot see my girlfriend. But we are doing what we can do with what we have. Sorry for my English, it\\'s early and that is not my first language. So be patience.It was released on the same date in Canada as the US, though. Not sure what the delay for us is but it\\'s only a few days so whatever.It said that in the US too before they released it today.Disney’s taking advantage of everyone being home during the coronavirus, so they’re releasing early because of the business opportunity they’ve been presented withHaha that\\'s the one I hated, but mostly because I never cared for 80s music.Stay strong dude. Watch lots of films and boxsets, read books and play games to help keep your mind off of what\\'s happening.The music coming from the window sounds really awesome and can feel the joy just by reading that.Also your English is fine and better than a lot of native English speakers lol.>  Every day at different hours, someone choose a song and at max volume it will be blasted outside the window, this way all the neighborhood can listed together the same song and dance and sing. It\\'s pretty fun.Silver lining. That\\'s cool.We do not work for Disney. You need to ask themYesThis was me (35) and my 33 year old sister 😂😂😂The adults in my theatre cracked up too.I’m 19 and found it funny lolI\\'m 22 and I\\'m watching it for the first time now and I laughed at it.He’s great through the whole movie. It felt like his thoughts on impermanence were plucked from my own brain lolOh I did too, just not with the near-frightening ferocity of my daughter lol.I read that as \"Order Code 66\"The Senate ordered the clones to destroy all legal documentsHaha very funny. This is clearly a joke and nod to Star Wars. Very clever my friend ;).Am also getting this issue. For those wondering, I\\'m in Ireland.Same issue. UKIt...isn\\'t though, I can\\'t create an account on the website.Same, wanting to watch Simpsons.Maybe download it instead of the websitenIsn’t it also Paramount?They\\'re currently on Netflix. Probably a licensing thing.Disney bought Indiana Jones yes, and they have the rights to the franchise and the character - Indiana Jones 5 comes out next year.But they didn’t get the rights to the original 4 films. Hopefully they do...but as of now Paramount owns those in full and decides what happens to them. Unless Disney does another deal getting those films back from them permanently but as of now nothing has been announced.Indiana Jones 5 without a doubt will be on Disney+ when it’s time. As for the 4 other films though, it’ll be a very long time due to the contract with Netflix being for years.This was all worked between the two companies in 2010. Paramount held the distribution rights for the original Phase 1 MCU films, including the (then) in-development *Iron Man 3* and *The Avengers*. Part of Disney\\'s deal to buy out those distribution rights was recognizing Paramount\\'s \"in perpetuity\" distribution rights to the first FOUR Indy films and the TV show, and Paramount waved any claim to future ones.All 4 Indy movies went out of their way to incorporate the Paramount logo in the opening shots. How you just gonna disregard that?My personal favorite was Temple of Doom\\'s transition to the gong. Then again, I just adore Temple of Doom. Raiders is objectively the best one... but Temple is my fave.Allow me to bring them over to Disney+ for you...  kali maaa.... kali maaa..... KALI MA!!!&#x200B;\\\\*sucks heart from Disney+ chest\\\\*  There we go.Weirdly, if you’re in the U.K., iTunes has all 4 films for £15. 🤷\\u200d♂\\u200dYes, Paramount has the distribution rights, and they have a streaming deal with Netflix. If Indy does ever come to Disney+ it won’t be for a while.That is true, they should have an agreement for itTime for a Disney-Paramount merger then!! 😜It was just the 25th anniversary of the ride what better time than to have done it then ?Nice oneNiceParamount isn’t going to give up its distribution rights unless Disney is willing to fork over a LOT of money. If you don’t want to stream them, my suggestion would be to just buy them digitally on iTunes or the Google Play Store.They might, but it probably does not expire for a while.> original 4 films3 films I think you will find...When they legally can put it on Disney+ would be a better timeThanks, I\\'m all about them Sankara Stones...:P𝓷𝓲𝓬𝓮 ☜(ﾟヮﾟ☜)#Nice Leaderboard**1.** `u/GillysDaddy` at **17711 nices****2.** `u/OwnagePwnage` at **11911 nices****3.** `u/RespectfulNiceties` at **8332 nices****...****203960.** `u/Foxplays132` at **1 nice**---^(I) ^(AM) ^(A) ^(BOT) ^(|) ^(REPLY) ^(**!IGNORE**) ^(AND) ^(I) ^(WILL) ^(STOP) ^(REPLYING) ^(TO) ^(YOUR) ^(COMMENTS)Temple of Doom isn’t *that* badCould be until 2022.I think they were talking about Crystal Skull idkI know, I was making a jokeMonique is almost certainly a she, not a he. But anyway, thank you for fighting for P&F episode order. They\\'ll never fix or acknowledge the issues. It\\'s time we accept it. I\\'ve reached out to the press before but they apparently only want to cover the Simpsons aspect ratio issue despite this affecting way more shows.So I tried with another agent... it\\'s Monique again.  What are the odds?  And again he\\'s not responding.I\\'m going to keep fighting the fight and complain daily until it\\'s fixed.  I want the episodes in order in time to rewatch the show before the new movie comes outI really wasn\\'t a big fan of Kingdom Keepers but I liked Kevin\\'s stuff so I\\'ll be cautiously optimisticThat could be great! I assume it would be animated considering filming in the parks would probably be too logistically difficult.Hadn\\'t even thought of that. Makes sense, though I would prefer live-action obviously. Still, I\\'d be down for an animated seriesI don’t get it, is something missing or just rearrangedWhen it aired in the UK, it was aired in 4 parts....I still have the 4 parts recordedDoes it still have that credit sequence in the multi part episodes?Missing, in a way.Yes.I have the same issue. It\\'s ruining the viewing for me. Let me know if you find the resolution for this.Changing the password doesn\\'t do anything unless those people log out. Best option is to delete the account and start a new one. He should not give his friends any login information for the new account.You can’t.You can change your password and keep new people from logging in, but you can’t log anyone else out or deactivate a device. This is one of several *massive* holes in D+ security. Disney+ customer service will work with you to cancel and move your account if you tell them you have  been hacked.Go smack your brother and tell him to smarten the f up. :PPlease do contact customer support over this. I cannot believe they haven’t created a way to log people off yet. It’s crazy.Only those who know the new password will be able to loginCancel your subscription and when it\\'s over every one will log out and then change your password and subscribe againChange his password is the only way.Change the password.Wow, that\\'s terrible. I assumed all of these streaming services would have that simple Netflix option to just log everyone out so they have to log back in - that would be absolutely trivial to implement, surely.Alright man thanks a lotSo that kicks everyone from the accountNo problem!Nope.It will keep *new* people from logging in. It will not log out the ones already connected.No, you have to contact Disney+ support and ask them to log every device out from your account.Oh okay thanksThis isn’t Disney SupportCause you don’t have money so after your free trial it cancelled itThank you. I can clean the house a little. My daughter got sick of the little mermaid and the original Frozen.Already able to watch in California, but not in 4K :(Maybe unpopular opinion: This is better than the first one and so is the music you just don’t realize it until you have watched it 7 or so times.Yup, we’re about 8 mins into it!  In the US.Not sure if this is an unpopular opinion or not, but I clicked play to see the Show Yourself scene again, and that song and scene was better than Let it Go.  I think what made it even better was it was a duet, while Let it go was all Elsa.  Show Yourself was such a great Disney number.I’m personally so excited to see this! 26 male.My daughter just screeched that she found it.Awesome news!Awesome move by Disney!What about Canada?This explains why my app crashed.Literally just bought it last weekend lol. Oh well,Now the kids  have 2 media’s to watch it from.Still gotta wait till 31 of July in AustraliaAh g\\'damnit I just rented it off youtube 2 days agoMy app crashes every time we try to load this - anybody else having this issue?Movie made no sense but for some reason We still love it and so does my toddler. Lol.Good. While I have no intention of watching it, I’m sure my nieces will be thrilled to see itI was so confused when I saw it on my home screen. But, it was a pleasant surprise.I just watch it with my kids. It’s really sad. My wife is leaving me so it hit pretty hard.But it’s not 4K and Atmos.Goddamnit I rented the movie like an hour before it was available for Disney+It\\'ll be in 4k on Tuesday.Now it is available in DVision/DAtmos in USHave two daughters who pretend to be Anna and Elsa and we went to the matinee opening. Watching it tonight with them enraptured.  Wish the music was Frozen 1 quality, but F2 is a better story.I\\'m ready to cry over >! a talking snowman !< again!Frozen 2 is way better than frozen.I haven\\'t even watched the first one... Double action time!Why do we have to wait 3 months normally?It\\'s not available in Canada until June? That sucks.  Was hoping to watch it with my kids while we are stuck home.Dang it I wasted 2 bucks on Redbox lolHow about in Canada??Why is Frozen 2 only HD/5.1? Almost every other newer movie is Atmos/Vision. Is it because it was released early?I finally saw this movie thanks to D+, and my what a wonderful movie this is![removed]Now that it is out...when does “Into the Unknown” the docu series come?Title is like when you’re downloading a game and it downloads enough for you to open it.Apparently we\\'re expected to get it on Tuesday here in NZ?How about the netherlands?oooo i will watch this tonight!This was the best surprise news we’ve ever gottenTuesday in australiaThey bumped this up three months. Good on them :)I just rented it yesterday lolNo reason to take kids to the theater anymore.Switch on your motion interpolation on your TV if you have it. It\\'s awesome in high frame rate. Honestly, all animations should be in 60fps at least.Seriously, they need a coming soon page.  I just wasted $2 at the Redbox on that POS, this weekend.[removed]Not as sick of them as you are.Yeah, believe 4K will be available TuesdayWonder what the logic behind that decision is, to delay the 4K release by a few days. Just a silly complaint since we got the entire film early, but still curious.On rewatch 10 at least.  Can confirm.i realized it the first time i saw it though100% . I felt that from the first time seeing it, and still think it after the 30th time.I’ve been saying this since the first time I saw it and people said I was crazy. Glad people are finally coming around. The music is way better.Oh man STRONG disagree.The self-care lesson and the themes in this movie far outweigh those in the first. Also, the songs are way better. Frozen just keeps getting better and better as it goes along. (Like a snowball... Sorry, couldn’t resist.First movie is better, second soundtrack is better.Great movieThat\\'s not an unpopular opinion, many people thought it was fenominal and lightyears better than the originalI was crying like a baby during “Show Yourself”. Very powerful and touchingIt was a bit more fleshed out than the first one, more real themes.25 yo with 3 yoYea my 6 y/o was like astonished momentarily, “it downloaded!!”Not until Tuesday unfortunatelyWe should get it tomorrowhttps://twitter.com/disneyplus/status/1238638515904065536[deleted]We bought it to have a DVD copy for the car. A small price to pay considering how few dvd/Blu-ray we buy any more.You only have to wait until Tuesday. App probably hasn’t updated to reflect the new datesthat will supposedly be made available next Tuesday when it comes to other countries.* post production coordinator watches file export progress bar intensely *Watch it 15 times. Frozen 2s music is really good. It’s just jarring after listening to 7 years of frozen 1. Some generic songs but overall some really great stuff. Personally I like it more than the first but at first I did not.Better songs, visuals and funny moments. But the plot is worse.I\\'ve been looking forward to watching them back-to-back. Should be an interesting experience.because if they release it on both blu-ray and on D+ at the same time then physical media sales would tank for that particular titleThey obviously put this out earlier since a lot of people are stuck in their house trying to avoid the virus.They tweeted it would be Tuesday-they left that out of the original announcement.No, Canada’s date is moving up as well. Will be available on Tuesday, and in 4K.[https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/13/entertainment/frozen-2-disney/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/13/entertainment/frozen-2-disney/index.html)TuesdayBecause it’s currently HD only. UHD available from tomorrowRise of Skywalker was released almost a month later. Disney released it early on digital yesterday, but the physical copy release is still set for 3/31. No chance they release it on D+ before the physical release.TROS came out December 2019, Frozen 2 came out November 2019. Frozen 2 came out on Home media last month, TROS was meant to come out next Tuesday but was released early yesterday for digital purchase, the physical media version is still set for its original release date of March 31st, so even if it follows in Frozen 2\\'s footsteps, I wouldn\\'t expect it on Disney+ until next month at the earliest. also Maleficent 2 came out October 2019 and on Home media this January, but that one hasn\\'t even been given a release date on Disney+ yet, overtaken by Frozen 2. so theres no way to predict what Disney will do with future Disney+ releases.[removed]Tuesdaythis is a one time exception, and even this film was available for home media purchase for about a month before being available to stream, it was originally not meant to stream until June 26. which would be 7 months after its theatrical release in November 2019.if you can wait that long to watch a movie, then yes, no need to go to theatres.but you\\'ll get all these advertisements for it while its in theatres, and then again during the home media sales, so your kid may need to be distracted with other movies, if you don\\'t want to give in to them asking to watch a new film before its made available to stream.There’s no way Disney (or any other studio) would spend more money and extend production times to do 60fps releases of animated movies, which some people would like, some people wouldn\\'t, and most people wouldn\\'t know the difference.They just wouldn\\'t make that money back.they posted about it coming this June earlier this week, but then yesterday they announced it would be available starting this Sunday, but it became available today. It will come to other countries on Tuesday and be made available in 4K then too. This is however a one time exception, most other movies don\\'t get released on the streaming service until 7 months after its theatrical release, 3/4 months after its home media release. Frozen 2 was released theatrically Nov 2019, on home media Feb 2020 and was scheduled for streaming on June 2020, which is the typical wait time.Follow them on twitter. They tweeted about the early release yesterday eveningIf it\\'s a POS, then why did you buy it? Besides, $2 is the price of a coffee. You didn\\'t break the bank or anything. A month of D+ costs more than both.[removed]What makes you say that?So would the 4k version replace the HD one?Could be the encoding time required for 4K video to get the video in the size / quality Disney is wanting.Olaf ages like a fine wine. I think about his wisdom daily.And we respect and honour you for that. But we all have our own journeys. Mine took a few viewings. I think I am on viewing 15 right now with my 4 year old and the movie still is really quite enjoyable.Yea same, my fiance almost walked out it was so incoherent to us. One of the first films that I fully cannot relate to the people who love it. Like, did we watch different movies? *that being said* it clearly wasn\\'t for me so I\\'m not trying to take any enjoyment from others, I just don\\'t get it.After watching it again, the moment the duet part of the song kicks in, I got chills.  You get this build in the song and then the climax happens and you think, yeah Elsa is badass.  And the scenery?  I honestly wish I had watched this film in 3D.I’m a dad who was dragged to the theater for this *during* a football game I wanted to watch because it was a Girl Scout event. I was full-on crying with both eyes during the reveal. Had to try to be tough during the rewatch tonight since I wasn’t in the dark lolIt says June 26 in the app for Canada.  But Tuesday would be a nice surprise.Can you share where you got that information? I think there agreements with Cineplex as very restrictive in terms of windowing (timing of when things go to buy digitally, rent, disney +) The app still says June 26th. Haven\\'t found any from Disney where they have said Tuesday.We aren\\'t, we are getting it June 26th, apparently due to existing agreementsAll the social media pages say Tuesday! Are you sure you just don’t have the trailer?Weird. Only see the trailer.Thank you for this.Show Yourself and Into The Unknown are both amazingly written and performed. All Is Found is also a bit haunting. I love this movie much more than the first!Samesies. We actually like a few of the songs from the second one better. Except nothing can top \\'Love is an open door\\' lol.I plan to be...frozen...to my seat for both of them. :Pha.Yeah true. Still though that’s not a very long time between those releases so I really hope it’s on there before June or May. One can hope. I originally thought it would be on there in July or even August & probably/hopefully not beyond that.Hmm that’s very interesting. I guess all I can do is hope it doesn’t last the entire year for it to finally be on Disney Plus. I kinda feel bad about buying a 3 year subscription and I haven’t used it much at all. I guess I better get to watching stuff.Not sure how much more that would cost, today\\'s video games almost have similar graphics being generated in real time at 140+ frames. I\\'m sure it won\\'t be that much more work for big animation studio doing pre rendered animation.[removed]https://www.engadget.com/2020/03/13/frozen-2-disney-plus/You’ll be presented with a 4K or HD option depending on the capabilities of your deviceCould also be that they anticipate this being watched A LOT and they’re trying to stagger the bandwidth hit on their servers.As soon as they decided to push up the release, I said a silent prayer for the people who were going to have to work overnights QCing the movie just for the 1080p and lower versions.It is absolutely this.  The copy that was encoded for digital release is not the same for streaming.  So it isn\\'t just a file transfer.Doing a multi pass takes time and is limited to a single machine.  Then you also have to go through the verifying of bitrates so they can be as close to the data cap as possible.  Multiple resolutions and bit-rates within them.  Plus quality assurance.  You then need to watch through the release to make sure artifacting doesn\\'t suddenly show up for no reason.  I don\\'t know what their system is like but it might not be automated yet for the 4K HDR streaming.Samantha?!?\"We call this making the best out of what we can control\" is so relevant right now.[deleted]“Incoherent” seriously? It’s fine to like it less, or even dislike it outright - but incoherent? How do you consume any movies if Frozen 2 was incoherent to you?100%. I was kind of confused upon first watch with the storyline and just what was happening in general. But upon second watch, I prefer it to the first one. Better music, great message, all of it was great.The June 26th date was before they made this decision. They just haven’t updated the app to show the new dateDisney press release: https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/the-walt-disney-company-will-make-frozen-2-available-on-disney-three-months-early-beginning-sunday-march-15-2/Definitely the full movie. Watched a good 10 minutesI love the folk song about the river. Just so beautiful.since Frozen 2s original expected streaming date was June, I expect TROS to be available in July unless Disney decides to release it earlier. most movies start streaming 7 months after its theatrical release, 3/4 months from the home media release. If you are not a big Disney fan, perhaps the service isn\\'t worth an annual subscription. most Disney movies cost $19.99 or more independently and hardly ever go down in price. so $7/mo for most of their content is an absolute steal, especially in 4K. and the monthly cost is an even lower if you have an annual plan.Those aren’t similar graphics at all. The animation in Toy Story 4 took 60 to 160 hours *per frame* to render. Granted, those render hours are what it would take for a single computer to accomplish the task and they have hundreds of computers crunching away at it in their render farm, but it is not even close to the graphics that are done in gaming.https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.insider.com/pixars-animation-evolved-toy-story-2019-6%3fampIt costs a lot of money and time to render a Disney or Pixar movie. They’re not going to add 2½ times as much work to their render farm if they don’t need to. Pixar actually held off rendering anything in 4K until Toy Story 4 because they did tests and found most people didn’t notice the difference between 2K and 4K in a theater.Thanks.As I read this it said the 4K will be available only to another countries, not in USA? Just the wording kinda threw me offWill it have Dolby atmos? Like the 1st one?Interesting, why is the digital release copy (assuming Vudu, Fandango, iTunes?) different from streaming (Disney+)?  Wouldn\\'t bandwidth constraints be similar between the two?Same goes for “Improving technologies are both our saviors and our downfall.”Lol I\\'m assuming this is sarcasm, or a parenting Stockholm syndrome joke.Edit: I only mean that a film should not need 6-9 viewings to discover it\\'s good so that seemed like a joke or a \"my kids love this so I\\'ve seen it 20 times this week haha\" thing. I could understand needing a second viewing to enjoy a film and I\\'m sure if you like this film you would obviously watch it a million times. But I also wouldn\\'t tell people that \"oh you don\\'t like Lord of the Rings? well you might need to watch it 6-9 times before you do\" unless I was being facetious because I\\'ve personally watched LotR a bajillion times.The movie was very disjointed and had terrible pacing, a ton of telling and not showing. Way to much exposition for a sequel and a children\\'s film. From a writing standpoint it\\'s a mess. Kristoff kept being shoehorned in as if they kept forgetting he was a character, Olaf was distractingly annoying and meta for a children\\'s film (who is that even for? As an adult Olaf annoys the living bejesus out of me but I can\\'t imagine kids really get anything out of a sentient snowman having an existential crisis anytime he\\'s on screen). Essentially by incoherent I mean the entire film felt like 10 people cobbled together a plot without talking to each other \"let\\'s throw in an 80s montage, let\\'s throw in some native people, let\\'s make everyone more neurotic than the first film, let\\'s throw in some more blatant queerbaiting, oh shit we forgot to have Kristoff actually propose let\\'s get this in in the last 10 minutes of the film\". Like I\\'m glad people are enjoying it but from a story construction standpoint it\\'s a dumpster fire which was too distracting for me to just settle down and enjoy the songs.Oh also! Elsa essentially will become the fifth Element if she subdues the other four elements. Great! got it. So she beats fire, wind, and water. But not earth?? Because they needed earth to serve as a plot point later I guess?!? Or because they forgot to show a scene where she subdues them? Again the continuity in this film has issues.But I get it - the average person this is geared towards is either A. A child or B. Someone who isn\\'t overthinking it like that.Thanks!Crazy, not for me!Alright cool thank you for the help. I guess there’s nothing I can do about buying the 3 year subscription anymore but just try to enjoy what’s on there & give it a chance. July would be great.Not confirmed but pretty sure it will as the 4K Blu-ray has it.The story is about Elsa finding her place in the world and Anna responding to it by breaking away from her sister and becoming more independent, and it\\'s expertly written from that perspective. Their arcs are interwoven and run very parallel to each other. Kristoff has little screentime because the story is not about him; he just symbolizes Anna\\'s newfound independance when the proposal happens. Throughout the film, there\\'s also underlying themes of facing the truth and growing from it, and it\\'s integrated very well into the two main character\\'s arcs. In fact, all the elements of the film except Olaf\\'s interjections and Kristoff\\'s very out of place song contribute to those two main arcs in some way.You say the movie is for children and people who don\\'t think, but quite honestly it seems you didn\\'t understand the film.Dude what? I mean there’s a lot to unpack here so I’ll just take the thing I think most exemplifies your misunderstanding of the film:Where did you get the idea that Elsa has to subdue the spirits to become one herself? Subduing them is irrelevant. Elsa’s task was finding out the true past of Arrendelle and making things right, which she does in coordination with her fully human sister and now Queen of Arrendelle.It’s a reparations story about the importance of the elements of nature and humans working together. I seriously don’t know where you got the idea that Elsa had to subdue the spirits to achieve that status.There’s no way they have the full movie legally.Ok thanks. It just seemed odd that the first one has it but not the 2nd.Y\\'all are ridiculous. I\\'m sorry that you\\'re personally offended that I don\\'t like this film but my point still stands that it is a poorly constructed film while all of you are trying to convince me that it is a good story, which I am not talking about at all. Regardless of the actual plot, it has terrible pacing. All of this to say that *for me* it was bad enough to take me out of enjoying this film. Also expertly written is.... Heavily influenced by your opinion. The writing is fine but it\\'s nothing groundbreaking.Lol, don\\'t make me rewatch that film to find the minor subplot point about the spirits. This still relates back to poor story construction. Even if it\\'s not explicitly stated (I thought it was but that\\'s irrelevant to my point) setting up a subplot involving four spirit types, where she tames three and which blend together visually when she reaches the ice cave mean that the story lacks symmetry when the earth spirits are not treated in the same way. Also on the flip side, they spend waaaay too much time on the spirits when they\\'re largely irrelevant. Again this goes back to the poor pacing.Also please see my other response. I am not arguing whether the plot of this film is good. I am saying that *I* did not enjoy this film because it was poorly constructed which prevented me from settling in to enjoy it. I realize this does not annoy everyone.But please everyone, continue trying to explain to me the deep nuance of this film as I\\'m sure I\\'ll suddenly see the light if you just explain it *enough* and I\\'ll see the incredible error of my personal opinion of not liking a Disney film.I\\'m fully with you and your description of the plot was spot on. The convoluted mess it was is even more surprising when you remember it\\'s a children\\'s movie. The beauty of most Disney movies is that they\\'re allegorical in some sense. This was not, and even when viewed entirely in universe it\\'s still confusing and bad.There’s no deep nuance. It’s a really simple story with very simple plot structure. You’re very hung up on Elsa not taming the earth spirit when you just kind of made up your own goal for Elsa in your head. The only goal that’s ever stated and realized by Elsa in the movie is “I’ll free the forest and restore arrendelle” which she does by revealing the truth about the past to Anna. I’m not really personally offended I’m just extremely curious how anyone could watch any movie if they find frozen 2 incoherent.Summer 2020, q4 2020,q1 2021The rest of Western Europe will get it in the summer this year, in Eastern Europe it will be released between summer this year (2020) and summer next year (2021).[Source](https://www.cnet.com/news/disney-plus-now-streaming-frozen-2-in-a-coronavirus-coping-surprise/)probably neverWhat?

In my opinion, the best live action Disney movie of the year as well (with exception to Marvel).“The Imagineering Story” is a fantastic watch, detailing the engineering and imagination behind many of Disney’s theme park attractions.  If you are missing Disney World or Disneyland (especially since they are closed currently) then this a great show to see.“Free Solo” details Alex Honnold’s ascension up El Capitan in Yosemite with a rope.  One of the most gripping documentaries I’ve ever seen.Marvel\\'s Runaways if you\\'re into YA shows.Agent CarterMine too! Phineas and Ferb was my favorite show and i think MML might be better.Tron: LegacyAll of the Star Wars movies :)Duck Tales XD is fresh!*The Muppets* (2015-2016)Please don’t watch The Simpsons, the aspect ratio is awful. For a better experience, wait until they fix it which will hopefully be before the UK release since that’s the smart way to go about it.Marvel movie marathon!!underrated comment.That’s probably one of my favorite shows on the service! Thank youWorking on the last season.  Cory and Shawn\\'s bromance humor is hilarious.  Probably not highly accepted in today\\'s culture though.Same here, I like it’s story ark and all the characters. But I also do realy love p&fand tron uprising.It depends on the licensing. Most feature films that aren’t D+ Originals only have English and Spanish in the US because of licensing.If you want to watch it in French, you have to use the Blu-ray.Just checked on mine and it’s available to download, so not sure what’s going on for youAvailable for me to download. If you’re using a supported device for downloads but you’re not getting the option to do so, you should contact support.It\\'s not available for me to download, either.Somethings are not available for download I don’t know why but they areIt\\'s available for me.I can\\'t download the first avengers movieThere\\'s an easy way to find out if they fixed it or not - Start up an episode that should be 4:3 and see if it is or not.And we\\'re still in \"early 2020\".As was asked multiple times in the past few days: no. They have at least until June. But that could be delayed as well.Under the Mickey Mouse and Friends collection. There\\'s not a ton on there but the Art of Skiing and How to Fish are there.Thank you. He should have his own collectionAnother way to find it is Movies -> shortsIt has all the shorts available on Disney+ listed there, minus the Brave Little Tailor which is hidden in the Extras of *The Sword and the Stone* and the short circuit original shorts (which are short even by short standards.)Stop trolling.Clear your Temporary Internet files and try it.Tried that. Works for a bit but then just happens againClone Wars happens between 2+3, Rebels happens between 3 and RO, and Resistance happens before 7, during 7and 8, and then before 9. You definitely need to see the prequels to gave a basis for CW. Rebels arguably works without the prequels but is better with them.That order. Clone Wars - rebels - resistance.  Clone Wars takes place between ep 2 and ep 3 if you feel like watching the movies, and rebels takes place after ep 3. Resistance takes place before force awakensIt\\'ll probably help to watch the prequel trilogy first. Then Clone Wars, then Rebels as some storylines from Clone Wars carry over to Rebels.  There are a couple of easter eggs in Resistance, but no major storylines from Clone Wars or Rebels.Have him watch the prequels and then Clone Wars because Rebels is a sequel to Clone Wars. Resistance is kind of it’s own thing but it’s not nearly as good as Clone Wars or Rebels.There are probably some rights issued tied to the date; there might also be some legal agreements. If they were in a situation where they could just press a button and launch early without any complications I think they would have already.Disney+ launches a week from tomorrow in the UK. Have some patienceHere in Luxembourg its supposed to release on the 24th of this month, but considering everything is closed and we are not allowed to go out besides for work, I would love to have disney plus already 😅this is the situation where legal agreements and money are more important than people :/Thanks mate I know almost nothing about this so my badReally? I heard it was a month from now but I just checked and yeah it’s a week. My bad u/bob0924 I just misunderstoodI never even slightly mentioned anything like that lmao, I said that it would be a good idea to release it earlierI read as early as October 2020Regardless, you lose promotional pricing on any annual/multi year pricing for Disney+ when you get the bundle, because they only credit you the equivalent monthly amount of what you paid under your multi year plan.So instead of getting $6.99 off the bundle for already having Disney+, they would only take away $3.92 in your case.And they would only take away $5.99 for Hulu, even as you pay $11.99 separately for it for the ad free versionleaving you paying $3.08 for the Bundle ($12.99-$3.92-5.99)Someone who pays the regular monthly rate for Disney+ and has Hulu separately, would only be paying a penny for the Bundle (12.99-6.99-5.99) so that extra $3.07 that you would be paying for you to get the bundle, basically means you’re paying back the amount you’d been discounted for getting the multi year plan anyway. ($3.07+ the $3.92 equivalent monthly pricing under your multi year deal = $6.99, the full monthly price of Disney+. At which point your pricing becomes no different than if you’d just paid the regular monthly rate, so no point to having paid large sum upfront as you end up losing any of those savings anyway when you Bundle.If you’re a paid D23 member then I’d contact D23 customer service and ask for assistance.  If you have a free D23 membership tho they aren’t as helpful.Thanks for the break down. I was able to here the D23 promo back and just elected to get ad-free Hulu separately.Luckily, I was able to get my D23 promo back and ended up getting Hulu(ad free) separately.Mine has the same problem.PS4 with PCM output doesn\\'t use the surround speakers at all.Strange thing is the receiver reports getting a LPCM 5.1 48kHz signal.Netflix, games and Blu-rays all play 5.1 sound correctly with the same settings.You’ve got something funky going on because I use a PS4 to stream on Disney+ occasionally and I’ve never had this issue.Are you using optical audio out? This was a known issue with Netflix and PCM when downgrading DD+ 5.1 soundtracks in 2017 and 2018 only on the PS4.It\\'s a PITA but if you set your PS4 to \"Bitstream DTS\" output or Dobly you\\'ll get full surround from Disney+. The issue is with the App not your equipment.What\\'s your audio output, PCM, Dolby, or DTS? It defaults to DTS or Dolby... Come back and let me know. D+ can\\'t handle PCM I\\'ve confirmed this with 3 systems and 4 receivers. Tested with basic 5.1 and Atmos streams on the platform.HDMI no optical and set correctly. I\\'ve tested on many machines just for my own sanity. It\\'s Disney+ I promise you, and surround works in every single other application on the PS4.Yeah I switched to Bitstream DTS and it works.Embarrassing, I hope they fix it.Support needs to recognise it, I\\'ve sent an email and called. Both times they said it was my receiver 🤣My D+ sucks on PS4. Perfect on everything else.Should a seen this coming.Luckily WandaVision has finished filming, and the second season of The Mandalorian (which I know isn’t Marvel).  I’m not sure how this effects post-production, and I suppose there could be some reshoots planned for these shows that are now delayed, but I’m hoping they’ll still release on timeEdit: the article mentions WandaVision is pausing production, but I do recall reading a couple weeks ago that filming had wrappedThey have plenty of time to rewrite Obi-Wan now.Makes sense. I’m waiting for them to announce that Black Widow is moving it’s theatrical releaseGod damn it!Am I stupid or something? Because Bucky doesn’t look like himself behind the maskWhen they say filming has wrapped does that include reshoots because maybe they were doing that?Post production on these projects is probably the larger piece.  Visual effects being the main part.These shows are pretty much like movies in terms of budget and scale so I’d assume they’ve planned for reshoots, but I doubt they’re near ready for that at this point.  Not sure how the pause in production will effect that though when the time does comeFalcon was set to finish shooting soon (I believe) and release in August, so it doesn’t sound like it’ll have a bunch of visual effects.  I feel like it’ll have a more grounded tone, with CGI only in occasional action sequences.WandaVision is supposed to be like a sitcom, but I have a feeling the later episodes will have some craziness to it that’ll rely on heavy visual effects.  This is why I feel like they can’t swap these shows release dates (being that WV is finished shooting while Falcon isn’t).I could be way off though.  We’ll find out eventually, which I’m hoping will be on the previously announced release dates, but even that’s in question now...I\\'m having the same issue...hoping someone has an answer!Yep, experiencing this as well.I\\'ve got more troubleshooting to do, but thus far:1. Samsung 4K TV + Chromecast Ultra = Muted colors2. Sony 1080p TV + Chromecast regular = FineSo it\\'s either the Chromecast ultra, the HDR version of the title, or the difference in TVs.I\\'m going to try swapping the two Chromecasts to see where the problem follows next.EDIT:1. Samsung 4K TV + Regular Chromecast = Fine2. Sony 1080p TV + Chromecast Ultra = FineSince I used the regular Chromecast on the 4k tv, it only displayed 1080p quality.This means Disney\\'s HDR title is the issue.so i have learned that it\\'s only certain titles when casting. For example, Frozen 2 looks perfect. Each toy story movie looks muted. why would this be the case?Ok maybe not.Now it\\'s working fine after re-plugging the Chromecast Ultra back into the Samsung 4k TV and playing HDR titles...I can\\'t seem to repeat the issue anymore, so I\\'m guessing me unplugging and replugging fixed it.What happened with the dad?No. They never will be.There was scandal with the actor where he, I think, did \"things\" with minorsOf course they will at some point. They\\'re not going to pretend the show didn\\'t exist. I just think they\\'re going to edit them all downNot really. Not even the Michael Jackson Simpson\\'s episode isn\\'t back on. And it\\'s been gone for about a year.That episode was not removed by Disney; it was the choice of the Simpsons creators to never show it again.Exactly. And Michael Jackson just had accusations. This other guy is in jail for what he did. So I don\\'t think we\\'ll ever see the other episodes of Andi Mack again.I think because it\\'s basically  most of the storyline I think that it\\'ll be differently. They can easily just cut him out. I guess we\\'ll see what happens in the UK because they\\'re advertising the full series every episode on their launch list and I really doubt that\\'ll happen but if it does then maybe it suggests there\\'s something more at playPress the star button on the remote. All subtitles for Roku go through Roku. The button will show you optionsThe full launch list can be found here:https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/disney-plus-uks-huge-launch-line-up-revealed-from-star-wars-to-the-mcuThere’s is quite a bit of X Men content including the 90’s animated series.The series you are after are available on US Disney+ apparently. So there is a good chance they’ll come to the UK version at some point too.Unfortunately, there are a LOT of animated series on there that aren\\'t available in Europe or the UK AT ALL.There\\'s no: Bonkers, Emperor\\'s New School, Talespin, The Replacements, The Proud Family and more!Sorry but them 2 are regional locked but I did think the proud family tv is on there but ain’t it my badThank you there is more than that list shows so hopefully x men evolution and wolverine and the x men 😀Agreed 😁But they both aired in the UK and seen proud family tv on a UK beta but x men evolution and wolverine and the x men aired here but when never on any streaming so I’m hoping 😁What is there more than what is on that list it seems pretty comprehensive?Yes, all of those shows aired here, yet they\\'re region locking shows for no good reason.Cheetah girls 3 and a few others[deleted]But I\\'m not talking about X-Men shows, I\\'m talking about region locked shows that are region locked for no reason.Oh soz but them 2 x men animated are regional locked but is the tv show of proud family thought that would be on thereAdd a way to remove devices please and thank youI\\'m watching Shop Class and Clone Wars. Also i\\'m watching all the Pixar Shorts on Disney+&#x200B;Will watch Frozen 2 tonightHSMTMTSA Simpsons iconStargirl. That was an amazing movie.Everyone please go to their feedback section on Disney+ and request Cosmos to be brought onto the platform!Muppets!Just watched Cars 2 for the first time, without any expectations.I loved it. Great, fun story, very nice voice acting and beautiful animation. Can\\'t believe this movie got such low ratings. Probably gonna watch Cars 3 today.**Stargirl** was awesome!On Tuesday, they\\'ll have **Frozen 2** in *4k*.The Mandalorian, The Clone Wars, Suite Life of Zack and Cody, Lab Rats, Frozen II, Diary of a Future President, and The World According to Jeff GoldblumWill all episodes of Mando be on the UK launch or will they be released weeklyWicked Tuna, but the news seasons still haven’t arrived!All the Descendants!!!Where is American dragon jake long, Dave the Barbarian and brandy and mr whiskers?TogoWeeklyYes, since you already pay for Disney+, you’d get a $6.99 credit, so you’d be left paying $6 for the Bundle to get access to the other 2 services. You could also get Hulu separately in case you wanted the ad free version. You’d get a credit of $5.99 since that’s the cost of the version supported by the Bundle. Leaving you just paying a penny for ESPN+ (12.99-6.99-5.99=0.01) however you would be paying all 3 separately then. Otherwise, wait for your month to end. Cancel it and then restart it but as the bundle in order to have it as just one singular price. Hulu will be limited to the ad supported version this way though.Yes, you can sign up for the bundle later if you want. The bundle used to be available only for the ad version, but you can add Disney+ to any of the other services for a different price.Because you can still watch the show. The aspect ratio might be slightly off but the insinuation that it\\'s literally unwatchable is ridiculous.Not to mention, whenever I mention what\\'s missing the the EU and UK versions, the \"help\" representatives just state all the stuff that\\'s on there already, instead of solving the issues.Exactly. This is how The Simpsons has been for 6 years before it was on Disney+ ever since FX did these masters.It\\'s obviously because someone else has the rights, and they can\\'t get them back from now.But yes there\\'s clearly a lack of transparency.Well, yes and no. FXX does air the show cropped, but their Simpsons World app offered the choice to watch the affected episodes in their proper aspect ratio. That\\'s one reason it\\'s been so confusing why they\\'re dragging their feet on this, they should still have access to the same 4:3 files that the now-defunct app had.No-one else has the rights to Bonkers though.Yes. Confirmed via the DisneyPlusUK twitter accountYeah, shame we can’t pre-install them thoWill it be available from launch day?Yes. Here’s the tweet:  https://twitter.com/disneyplusuk/status/1237793049465552896?s=21Thanks.If they use their regular schedule it’ll probably be June/July.They may release it early like they did with Frozen 2. If they do that, the film is scheduled to be released March 31 on blu ray so they may release it mid April possibly.Typical timeframe is 4-5 months after home video release. Why is it so hard to “stay legal”? If you want it now, pay the $20. Or just wait a few more months. Integrity.This has been asked a few times in the last few days. Typically 12-16 weeks after home release. Probably around July 1.Hedging my bets on this. Things in the US are going to get worse before they get better. I think Frozen 2 was released early 1) for the parents stuck at home with their kids, but also to get people to either keep their subscriptions or re-subscribe. The Blu Ray has been our for about 2.5 weeks. Taking those same metrics to Star Wars, the most likely current schedule is for some time in July, however if there are more and more quarantines preventing people from going out to buy the Blu Ray, I could see them dropping it on D+ around Easterhttps://apple.news/AvzfBmVT2QUqn2hOFlmVSCQ this makes it sound like it’s comingWould not be surprised to see it drop next weekend if things get worse here in the US.[deleted]I can’t find any site that will allow purchase from Canada and I don’t have a VPN. Frozen 2 isn’t released yet in Canada Disney+. I don’t mind waiting, hence the question of how long.Only reason I asked is because the timeline for the digital releases was updated due to COVID19 and I was just wondering if anyone new if the streaming service timeline would be updated.That’s an error. It’s not on Disney+ and won’t be released here for a few weeks minimum. They simply pushed up the digital release by 4 days.No way they’ll release it for at least a few weeks. Need the digital / dvd release window first.Frozen 2 was deliberately loaded to Disney+ ahead of the normal schedule. Whether or not Disney chooses to do that with Star Wars is purely speculation.The digital purchase date was only pushed up a couple days. Original digital release was this coming Tuesday.Nobody knows.FallWhenever it’s readylater this yearThanksOk so like October November?This is my prediction:The Falcon and the Winter Soldier S1 - August 2020 (confirmed)The Mandalorian S2 - October 2020 (confirmed)HSM S2 - November 2020WandaVision - December 2020 (confirmed)The confirmation was IIRC before the Corona virus spread. I would be surprised if they can still stick to this timeline as some shows are currently affected as well. E.g. Falcon and the Winter Solider is currently paused: https://deadline.com/2020/03/falcon-and-the-winter-soldier-halted-coronavirus-prague-disney-plus-1202878797/The Marvel shows are nearly done filming. I would imagine it’s shut down so they could MAYBE find a replacement location.WandaVision is more or less done filming. So, that COULD still make it’s December release.Woah, that\\'s like what 3-4 months early? Disney knew they had to do something for Coronavirus. Smart move.Cue millions of trapped indoors kids happy dancing.*but crosses fingers they get Infinity War early*Great news, my girls are off school until April and the 5 year old has been asking me non-stop for Frozen 2!In regards to international availability:> [Frozen 2 will be available on Disney+ in Canada, the Netherlands, Australia and New Zealand on Tuesday, March 17.](https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/the-walt-disney-company-will-make-frozen-2-available-on-disney-three-months-early-beginning-sunday-march-15-2/)March 17 will also be the day the film will be available to stream in Ultra HDPicture me on Sunday, I have to baby sit my 10 year old niece. I\\'ll load up Disney + and she\\'ll absolutely freak!Awesome.I guess you could say they Let It Go early. I’ll leaveLife frozen for the virus? Have Frozen 2.Well alright then. Time to start screaming **Show Yourself** like it’s no one’s business.That is an amazing gesture. I literally have chillsI wish Rise of Skywalker gets added, but I won\\'t be mad if it isn\\'t, as they need DVD sellsSounds like a win-win for them.  Everybody who was planning to buy a physical copy already did, and they\\'re not going to sell any more while people are in self-quarantine.  Might as well get the good press, and maybe even get a few more people signing up for D+ in the meantime.It would be great if they did Rise of Skywalker alsoGreat, now release Disney+ sooner in the UK.yes!!sorry huge frozen fan.I just rented it for my kids as I figured it would take a few months like Toy Story 4 did. Maybe they think more people would subscribe since more people are going to be home.Let’s hope Canada will get it Sunday also!I wonder if Rise of Skywalker will also get an earlier releaseFinally something goodI’d love to see more stuff come to Disney plus earlier. Even a couple weeks after the blu ray. I’ve been debating on canceling for a little bit now since there hasn’t been anything new I’m excited for.OMG THANK YOU SOOO MUCH DISNEY THANKSSSSSDoes this mean they will put Rise of Skywalker on here a bit early?YayWooo!!!What about the UK? Will it be on Disney Life?ThanksDisney is panicking because people have been cancelling subs. They have no new shows.Beggars can’t be choosers but I really wish they could get Star Wars ROS on Disney+ soon for us college kids who got booted into online classes. I haven’t seen Frozen 2 so I’ll give it a go, but I’d love to watch ROS again with my friends! Though I doubt we’d see the title show up until June/July. But since they moved Frozen up significantly, a girl can hope!Maybe it’ll even get people back into Star Wars and bring in more people to Galaxy’s Edge when the parks reopen.It’s live now!  Went on to watch another movie and clicking the banner allowed the play option.  About 10 mins in now.Is it happening in Australia? Cos it still says coming in July when I checkedGood, hope the movie is enjoyable for all the kids and familiesI\\'m a little annoyed cause I literally *just* rented it a couple weeks ago to finally watch it lol, guess I should\\'ve waited.But whatever I\\'ll just have to watch it againI can’t wait!Okay, take bets on if they will slap the \"Some flashing lights or patterns may affect some photosensitive users.\" line on the details to this one whether it\\'s needed or not.Disney preparing for nuclear winter.I hope they just give up and release New Mutants on Disney Plus instead and let me watch it NOW!Really makes you wonder why bother delaying having a new movie on Disney+ months after the theatrical release.I’m seeing that IW will leave netflix/hit D+ around the end of June or early July 2020 so at least it’s not a long wait nowCan they? That’s on Netflix so I would think they’d have to wait until the contract is up.IW is a very different situation, not gonna happen.GoodCanadian user here, thanks for the info!Show Yourself to the doorr/AngryUpvoteahhhh ah ahhhh ahhh ah ahhhh!Idk if it\\'s a gesture, more of them recognizing people will be stuck at home and this may push people to sign-up. Still cool nonetheless tho!> I literally have chillsNot me.  The cold never bothered me anyway.#***THEY’RE MULTIPLYIN’***Me too. I’ve purchased it because toddler girl, but man. I geared up a bit knowing why they did this.> I literally have chillsYou should get tested.We are quarantined for 2 weeks (3 if you include Spring Break) ... give it another week.agreed, even though I wasn\\'t a big fan of itI’m sad I had to scroll down so far for this. I haven’t seen it yet and I missed out on it in theaters. I hope it goes straight to Disney+. I think it will.You think people still buy “physical copies”? LOL.I doubt it.The article says both Sunday and Tuesday. Confusing!Yep confirmed🤞🏼Well the digital release (ie: iTunes, Google Play Movies/YouTube Movies, Vudu if you’re American) was moved up from Tuesday to yesterday night (in North America at least) so that is possible...https://www.darkhorizons.com/frozen-2-skywalker-hit-digital-early/Umm, I think they are releasing it in September from what I heard. If not, October - February 2021.Probably on HULU if they do release on streaming.I’m sure they would’ve already dumped it on one of their streaming platforms if they weren’t contractually obliged to give it a theatrical release.I wouldn\\'t mind if they released Black Widow instead lol.I know I know, just let me dream ok?DVD/Blu-ray/Digital salesCrazy. Australian Disney+ has had all the MCU movies since day one. Except of course Hulk and the two Spider-Man movies. Is US Disney+ really missing that many movies?If Black Widow gets moved it means sanity.Wishful thinking but a girl can hope!Just wishful thinking TBH.Go off Into the UnknownI was sure this movie was gonna drop In SummerThis is 100% the reason. It wasn\\'t supposed to be released on D+ until another 3 mo. Disney saw an opportunity with hundreds of thousands of people at home (and millions more to come in coming days/week) from school, work, quarantine, everything from sports and other events shutdown and pushed this up.Still very grateful and can\\'t wait to watch on Sunday.I know there\\'s a cynical reason behind it, but I enjoy the good reason behind it more.It’s a win-win.  Those who don’t own the movie can now watch it, and Disney+ will likely get more subs.  Nothing wrong with that PR move[removed]I doubt it. They wouldn’t miss out on those early dvd salesMaybe a few weeks to a month after thoughTell that to all the people buying every copy at the store two weeks ago.It\\'s confirmed to be the 17th for Canada according to this: https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/the-walt-disney-company-will-make-frozen-2-available-on-disney-three-months-early-beginning-sunday-march-15-2/It’s still not changed in the app.It would easily be Hulu\\'s biggest original if it releases there before theaters. bigger than Handmaids Tale>Is US Disney+ really missing that many movies?It\\'s just 2, *Infinity War* and *Ant-Man and the Wasp*what do you even mean by that i’m so confusedIf a lot of theaters are still closed, it almost certainly will be.Go get Lost in the WoodsGood one man lol[deleted]Me too :)[removed]They will look into getting disney+* this is going to be all over the news, it has never been done before, stocks will go up again for Disney (I mean they are already going up)Lol I mean I\\'m going to watch it and enjoy it (I haven\\'t seen it yet) but it\\'s just very obvious that they didn\\'t do this out of the kindness of their hearts. I love Disney and am literally on a Disney plus subreddit, but a company is still a company.Yeah. You’re right. I bet most Star Wars fans own a blue ray player. And kids are out of school in America so it’ll give those poor parents some break from them.“Every copy”. OKDigital sales are up and people can just buy/rent that way. Physical media has been on a massive decline.Maybe if it had released before Dark Phoenix, but now the hype for the movie has died down a fair bit. The movie doesn’t have the mass market’s attention anymore. Does the mass market care about a delayed spin-off to a dead franchise that was filmed 3 years ago and as a result has dated performances from the child cast?  Whereas with The Handmaid’s Tale, it’s got mass market appeal, it’s still a very much alive franchise and the author has recently-ish released a follow up.But those are on Netflix right now and pretty much every Disney+ subscriber also has a Netflix subscription. It doesn’t make much of a difference.Movies are being delayed left and right.Maybe I\\'ll get this joke thread When I\\'m Older.Maybe when I am older.That’s true, I guess Some Things Never Changeor how about **you** just shut up and be happy and thankful.They did this for Endgame at launch. This isn’t unheard of.Ummmm Disney has been taking a beating. They are front and center with COVID-19Yes? I\\'m not disputing that. But a massive decline is not instantaneous. There are still a lot of physical media people out there.People are still excited for New Mutants. Last weekend when i was ushering a theater a trailer came on for NM and the audiences reaction was the best.yes i am aware i was more confused by the second part of your statement but i guess it’s kinda unimportant anywayHas this thread been like a series of doors in your face?Fair enough, I live in the U.K. and audiences really don’t tend to react to things so have no way of gauging people’s interest.  Plus, my media consumption is skewed towards comic book movies so what I see on social media isn’t necessarily representative of the mass market. But also, they really marketed Dark Phoenix as the last film in the X-Men franchise, which would’ve been correct if New Mutants was released when it was meant to be.  The main reason companies are cancelling movies is because of profits, so them putting it on Hulu wouldn’t make much sense. I get now that the reason it’s shifted is because there are bans on people entering gatherings of over X number of people as well, but initially it was a purely profit-based motive.In a way, yes. I guess some things never change.TuesdayIt’s coming Tuesday, not sure why it’s a couple days after US.That would be 4 hours after upgrading to bundle.It doesn’t not charge you right away, it first checks to see what services you pay for with the same email address and then credits the costs of those services towards the bundle price so that you only pay the difference. If you pay for Disney+ and Hulu separately already, then it should only be a penny (12.99-6.99-5.99=0.01)Add a way to remove devices pleaseSo it charges you same day as bundling just not as soon as you bundleOh okHuh?I think they\\'re lost.Honestly I can’t tell you for sure, but my whole family shares an account and we still haven’t received a message stating that we have hit the max. My wife and I alone have logged in 5 or 6 devices. My sister uses it, and my parents with my other 2 siblings use it. I assume we are well over 10 devices.The stated limits are log-in on a maximum of 10 devices per account and play on 4 concurrently. There have been posts from people who reached the 10 device limit who claim they were blocked from logging-in again. At the time I read those posts, Disney had no way to log-out / remove a device, so those viewers were apparently capped at the 10. I’m not testing it myself.I have this same worry, and wondering if pre-ordering/signing up on my laptop will cause that to be a device. Or is it only when i stream something by hitting the play button like NowTv does it.I like to use my phone to browse what I want to watch but I never use it to watch things. I\\'m also planning to share my account with 4 other family members so i\\'m going to tell them to try and limit tk 2 devices each.>I have this same worry, and wondering if pre-ordering/signing up on my laptop will cause that to be a device.That\\'s a device. Every device you log into is a device.Thats a bit annoying, because I need to sign up before March 23rd and can only do that on a laptop since the apps not available. But I don\\'t intend to ever use my laptop to watch things onThen I recommend signing up from a device that you will use.Will be available this TuesdayI haven\\'t noticed that but I don\\'t watch a lot of musicals. Is it possible the volume is low on your center channel?Tried watching Frozen, iron Man, iron Man 2, Thor. All of them seem to have very poor sound quality. Receiver getting 5.1 in. No other services or sources have the issue. It\\'s almost unwatchable because you have to put the volume up way high to hear dialogue, but all other sounds (music/effects) are uncomfortably loud then. Turning off dynamic eq helped. Blu Ray versions sound wayyy better so it\\'s not the movies themselves. I\\'m on a nvidea shield and Denon 750h receiver with 2.1 speakersDefinitely not my center channel speaker! It seems to happen moreso when the music is very \"full\" and loud, high notes in music and vocals. It sounds compressed. But I have adjusted my home audio and tried a 2nd system as well (just a sound bar). I have yet to test it out on mobile, but I have only noticed it on 4-5 specific songs so it does not surprise me that you haven\\'t experienced it yourself.People have a lot of problems with the ps4 and disney+.If you have anything else to use that would probably be better.Exit and log back in, in about 5 minutes it haves some times if not call supportPS4 app is a hot steaming mess.Update I called customer support and they said there’s a weird glitch going on with my account that they were able to allow access for my ps4 thank you everyone I didn’t know they had a customer service phone number!Try using the web version, ps4 has a google or safari or something right?Thank you I called  :)[deleted]First I have it installed on 2 fire stick 4k and one of the older models and they all mostly work just fine.  Mostly just because some minor issues that are solved by restarting the app.I would say past experience with the firestick is that seems to like to save files after you uninstall an app.  You can install a file explorer app and look around to make sure it is deleting everything.  You would think a factory reset would have covered that, so if its new I would return it.Not the most helpful I know.I have this issue too:(.You\\'re not alone. Just tried two 4K fire tv sticks and can\\'t get anything. Plays for 5 seconds and then freezes, with no sound the whole time.Edit: I found a fix that worked for me. I had to go to Settings>My Fire TV then force an update in that menu. Once complete, Disney+ worked.Same issue. Has worked great since service launched. As of a week or two ago, spinning wheel, no access, about to cancel despite this quarantine!The service works fine on my laptop and phone, connected to the same wifi. When I did a factory reset twice, it updated the software. :-(It says mine is updated; so I can\\'t update it. :-(It may do that if you\\'re in Canada. If you change your language to English (UK) and then restart the app, that sometimes helps.Thanks!Did it work?Yep!Très magnifique!when you opt for the bundle, you get all 3 services (Disney+, Hulu and ESPN) for $12.99 ($18.99 if you want ad free Hulu, charged separately as $11.99 for ad free Hulu and $7 for the Bundle of the other two services.)if you already subscribe to one independently, you get a credit in the amount of that service. (so long as all accounts use the same email address.) and you would continue to be charged for each service independently.The exception being Hulu, which is capped at $5.99, the cost of the ad supported version that comes included in the bundlemeaning even if you pay $11.99 for the ad free version, you only get the $5.99 credit towards the bundle.If you pay for the annual subscription for Disney+, you also only get the $5.83 equivalent monthly charge credited back towards the bundle, instead of the regular $6.99 monthly rate. so yes, in your case, a $5.99 discount for Hulu, and $5.83 discount for Disney, leaves you paying $1.17 for ESPN. but you still have to pay the separate $11.99 for Hulu.so youre looking at, you paid $69.99 for Disney+, you\\'re paying $11.99 for ad free Hulu, and then $1.17 for ESPN.and you technically lose out on the discount you got for the annual plan, because if you\\'d just gotten the bundle, you would just pay the regular $11.99 for Hulu, $6.99 for Disney+ and only $0.01 for ESPN. So since you\\'d be paying $1.17 for ESPN, youre basically paying that $1.16 back towards Disney+ added to the $5.83 credit you get for having paid the annual rate, means you ended up paying the full $6.99/mo for Disney+ anyway.so if you dont need ESPN, I would just keep the separate ad free Hulu and annual Disney+ so you can maximize your annual discount, otherwise you didnt save anything on Disney+ by paying the annual rate upfront, if you\\'re still paying back the difference monthly in order to get the bundle.No.  The bundle is for Disney Plus, Hulu, and ESPN+.  If you were to bundle, you would be charged a penny more per month.Contact customer service and ask. We already paid for Hulu live with no ads and espn before this. Now we pay less than $3 a month (I think) for Disney plus.The bundle is for Hulu with adds. He’s paying for add free Hulu currently.Yep. Was just chatting with them. Let me know that I can bundle all 3 (and keep ad-free Verizon of Hulu since I used the same email for both accounts) and pay $1.17/ month. Can cancel Hulu and espn+ at any time.  Wish this had dawned on me earlier!The original bundle was ad-supported Hulu.  They have different tiers now which include ad-free and Hulu live tv.Just to reintegrate, the $1.17 is in addition to what you are currently paying for Hulu.  You are forfeiting your annual discount to get the bundle and paying the difference back (6.99 - 5.83 = 1.16), plus the penny I mentioned earlier.I heard they are bringing it to Dinsey+ I\\'m just waiting.Most Underrated Show!This show has so much potential!Yes, but they will add the 1st season to the content list  And i want them to do a 3rd season!That\\'s actually Bonkers.You forgot to change accounts[deleted]You might be right since I’ve never heard of that show until Disney +You about Сhange.org?What?Never got a DVD release.And it\\'s not even on there for the EU and UK.You forgot to change accounts[deleted]AhaWhy \"Yes!\"?I think this is a trollBut Bonkers is the most underrated one.Mmm?Isn\\'t Coco in Spanish listed as a seperate title on Disney Plus?There are two listings for Coco, both have multiple audio options. But the one that says spanish, changes o it the labels of certain objects to also be in Spanish. So to get the true authentic experience, you must play the Spanish version but then also change the audio to Spanish, not sure why it doesn’t just default to that, but alas, just a simple audio change. The English version also has a spanish audio track but the labels on things remain english.It does but when i last played it the language was the same I don\\'t know if they changed it back thoThere isn\\'t a Spanish version of Coco in Australia.I think you\\'re talking about the United States version of Disney+. I only have the Australian version.You have to change your audio to Spanish on the Spanish version. It still defaults to English. But it\\'s actually a slightly different movie so they have Spanish coco in both languages.Hoping for the same in the UK, stay safe everyone.[removed]We won\\'t have it at all😕(not on that phase)Wait you guys don’t have access at all?![removed]One can dream. It’s just 10 days early on the scheduled start which is March, 24th and school will be closed till April, 4th...No, Disney+ has been accessible from USA, Canada and Netherlands only. The rest of the world from March, 24th.New Zealand has it now tooMe too! I literally started watching again just because I wanted to see what they did to him instead of just being an kinda awful teenager. I\\'m loving it. I also love Camila.Have you looked at https://help.disneyplus.com?What\\'s your display resolution?Very frustrating. Trying to get information about this from their chat support right now. They first said, \"there should be a setting on the bottom bar like on one of the corners that gives you the option for the resolution\" (there isn\\'t). I then mentioned trying in both Firefox and Edge, and they advised me to try Chrome (no difference).   Next they said, \"the only information im finding in regards to the resolution is to change the display settings on the computer itself. not sure if you want to try that. i have some steps that i found\". My computer and my monitor are just fine.   After that they said \"...The video quality is based on the quality of the device and internet that you\\'re using.\" Again, I can watch other streaming services in HD just fine.  Can\\'t believe a media giant like Disney didn\\'t think about resolution settings.It’s on Netflix currently as part of the Disney Short films feature.Never saw Frozen Fever on there since launch. Found it pretty strange!Unfortunately it has to do with the stupid Disney shorts collection on Netflix. it looks like that is locked on Netflix for a while since they still haven\\'t got a landing page for itIt was released with the Live action Cinderella in 2015 and that isn’t available until Sep 1st, 2020. That might be whyThanks. Can confirm this is the correct answer (1:20 in). Not sure why they don\\'t at least have a landing page for it on Disney+, though.Anyone else looking for it: I highly recommend watching the whole thing, some of Pixar\\'s best shorts are on it!And for those planning on watching Frozen 2: you really have to see this first; there are several references to it in Frozen 2.I think depending on how long the quarantine lasts, they may surprise us with Star Wars around Easter. I guarantee you that part of why Frozen 2 was released so early (3.5 months) is due to the parks being closed and the next 3 theatrical releases being delayed. By releasing Frozen it gave subscribers a pleasant surprise, and people that aren’t subscribed yet now have more incentive to join while kids are out of school for 2+ weeks1) Disney announced it2) they moved up the digital release a few days early (for purchase) but I highly doubt it’ll be on Disney plus for another several monthsDisney announced that they’d be moving up the June 26 Disney+ release of Frozen 2, to this weekend. But TROS hasn’t gotten a release date at all yet, but I expect it to be sometime in July as Frozens was originally slated for June. Disney may decide to move it up though, who knows. Maleficent 2 which came out before them doesn’t have a release date yet either.TROS however was supposed to be released for Digital purchase next Tuesday but was made available early yesterday, I noticed because I saw my preorder now said I could play it immediately instead of the “Watch in 4 days” message that it had said before. Also available to purchase is the entire Skywalker 9 Movie saga digitally for a promotional price of $99.99, 4K included from Microsoft, Fandango or Vudu. Which is the same price for the previous 6 movie HD collection.Episode 9 is most likely going to come out on Disney plus in summer. Probably going to be around July-ish. Disney announced it just recently. You can purchase episode 9’s digital copy if you’d like.It\\'s kind of crazy to me that they aren\\'t putting Rise of Skywalker on Disney + right away. It\\'s their new platform and they need to give people reasons to sub / stay subbed.The way they found out was in the majority of the posts here that have said it’s coming out? Literally look in the topic and they show how they knewYah they’ll want to make their money before they release it on Disney plus.I\\'m furious. I got Disney+ for Star Wars and Marvel. If I still need to buy the movies or rent a shared item in time of Corona I\\'ll be so dissapointed in DisneyNo no no Disney should not be getting this both ways. If its available digitally it should be on disney plus.I mean that was the point of Disney plus... to not have to have digital copies separate but one big disney library. What a failure on every level but greed.They already have onward planned for april. Easter is in April. Chances are, they are putting in another movie that is not it in April. Chances are, they are putting Mulan or something (Disney might do that) in at Late April. The truth is: It isn\\'t on the list I read of all of this year\\'s scheduled releases on Disney +. I don\\'t think we are getting TRoS early, but rather Next Year.I pay for Disney+ so don’t really see the need to purchase the movies. Just got my hopes up while stuck at home.Where do you get it in digital?Skywalker is only for sale for $20, no rental.  Disney+ is only $6.  They would be undercutting themselves by a lot.  Maybe it will go on disney+ when digital rental is allowed.Agreed, why pay for Disney Plus if you just end up waiting longer compared to buying it separately on a different platform?  $$ plain and simple.Disney isn\\'t the only studio that does this, studios like Universal, Warner, Lionsgate, Sony all do this too when they sell the premium TV rights to channels like HBO, Cinemax, Starz and the like. It\\'s been the norm for years. And the studios creating their own streaming service, like Universal is with Peacock will also follow a similar pattern from now on.That said, should this early release of Frozen 2 be a huge enough success on the service and it will be a huge success, it could become a new normal for Disney to release their films on the service a month after Blu and Digital.I\\'m fine waiting 3 months after home media release, if I wanted to see ____ movie on home media I would have already.iTunes, Google Play, Amazon, Microsoft Store, FandangoNow, Vudu, any of the digital movie stores. The single movie is $19.99-$24.99, The Collection of all 9 movies is currently $99.99I\\'m amazed at the downvotes.. why would anyone defend getting ripped off?ThanksOk... so I got it on my iTunes, but now it won’t download over cellular (unlimited) and when I try to download over WiFi (horrible at home) it is too slow! 0.68 mbps slow! Why can’t we download over cellular if we purchased it? Disney+ allows download of its content to cellular. Anyone have a workaround?> why would anyone defend getting ripped off?I don\\'t buy physical media anymore unless it\\'s something I really want and really like. So the whole getting ripped off thing is dubious at best.Your answer is proving my pointI know they won\\'t do it, but I\\'d love for The Rise of Skywalker to release early.It\\'s not my favourite Star Wars movie, but I\\'ve got time to kill, so I\\'d love to have all 9 episodes available.All of them? But honestly Bluey season 2 being added same day as they air on Disney Junior would be cool.I know it is not likely, at least not this soon, but I hope eventually in the future, movies become available to stream much sooner than they are now, like with this special exception with Frozen 2.it was given about a month of home media release time before now becoming available to stream. yes that cuts a little into Disney\\'s revenue, but it still gives those who still want to buy movies a chance to do so beforehand, and Disney to make money off of them. but anyone else who usually waits to rent or stream, wouldn\\'t have to wait much longer.I feel that is more likely to be a possibility once and if people stop buying movies independently, waiting for the streaming version, and once they commit to continuous subscriptions instead of only a month here and there.when Disney feels it receives enough revenue in its streaming plan, and not making enough in home media sales, to justify just releasing movies to streaming sooner, to keep people subscribed, and save on home media release production. I don\\'t expect that happening overnight, but maybe sooner rather than later.Why is frozen in Dolby atmos? But not frozen 2? Frozen 2 only supports 5.1Same.They released the digital copy early.  I wish they had released Onward early. Then I wouldn’t have had to waste my money going to the theater.Will probably come when it\\'s available in 4k and worldwide on Tuesdaywhen they mention early, they mean early for its streaming debut, not in place of or before its theatrical debut. Disney will only debut movies it doesn\\'t feel will perform well enough theatrically on the streaming service, everything else, they will milk for every penny in its theatrical and home media releases.Haha was Onward that bad?Ok thanksJust checked and it now has atmos support.My husband and I thought it was awful.X900F - HDR/4K worked up until about a week or two ago. It was broken shortly after launch as well. They fixed it then, so I\\'m hoping it gets fixed again soon. There\\'s no dolby vision badge and the video quality is significantly worse than it was a month ago so it seems that 4k/HDR is broken as of right now. As far as Atmos, Disney Plus still can\\'t get it together. I went on tech support and the lady had no idea if there were even any plans to roll it out to Android tv. Netflix can do it, so I figured Disney could do it, but I\\'m not holding my breath. I believe the only way to get 4K/HDR/Atmos/Vision is through the Apple TV or Roku Premier.Did it seem as though the tech knew what any of that meant?Thanks for your reply.Same tv here, same issue. I’ve tried to reach out Disney plus support, which is a proper waste of time, since they ended up telling me there was nothing they can do. App is 1.3.0 and dolby vision just won’t work. It used to work just fine a few weeks ago.Edit : I was wondering if other Android tv were affected, for all the information I could find were mostly about Sony 900f.Yes, the tech was familiar with everything and thought it was already a feature on Android TV. She was surprised to find out it wasn\\'t, and could offer no information as to roll out plans.I\\'ve been frustrated with this service since it\\'s launch and I don\\'t want to buy yet another streaming device along with my pc, ps4 and fully capable tv JUST for one service. HDR was broken and repaired shortly after launch, it\\'s broken again, and this time seemingly with 4k broken as well, and there has been zero news of Atmos support ever rolling out to Android TVs outside of the LG oleds, which works on my parent\\'s tv with no sound system whatsoever. Which is frustrating because I have the proper setup and they are just using the TV speakers. I can\\'t cancel it because it\\'s got a ton of my favorite movies and upcoming stuff but I feel like I\\'m going to be forced to buy an apple tv at some point when I\\'ve given up on the app being properly supported.Try changing your language to English (UK) and then restarting everything. In Canada sometimes the stream will default to French unfortunately.Sounds like a regional issue. Try setting your app language to English (UK)Thank you for your response do I need to do this on every device or is there a single place to change it. I found under the profiles a language thing that had Us English selected. Is this the only place to change it.Just to update here this solution has not fixed it. Having my profile default land gauge set to UK instead of us English has not changed that movies titles and anyone other written stuff in the movie being French. Audio and subtitles are in English but not the actual video itself.4 concurrent streams, up to 10 profiles, 4K HDR on 4K HDR movies and TV shows, all for the same price, no tiers.$6.99 ($7?) is the normal and only price (unless you prepay for a year and I think it\\'s two months free). For the monthly price, there is no commitment.Some stuff is HD and some is 4k (and some older stuff is SD). Do the free trial and see if you\\'re happy with it.It\\'s the movie. Clone Wars had a cartoon movie before the show premiered.[Here\\'s the proper order to watch.](https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-the-clone-wars-chronological-episodeorder)The hour and a half one is a movie, seperate from the TV series.hope you have a good time watching it. i watched the seasons few weeks ago :)Its basically a pilot episode, watch it.The movie is not the best, but the show is amazing (you’ll love it if your a Star Wars fan)Starz has all D+ content?It\\'s the most awful movie. Feel free to skip.The clone wars movie is also the first four episodes of the series. Just like the Mandalorian, they\\'re also rescuing a baby.Thank you, so should I watch it before the show?Please use this!not all the content,but they have  most of  the disney & pixar & star wars and marvel content in the middle east. Neither netflix nor starz has the new disney plus content ( like the mandalorian)  here in the region. and prime video sucks here.You\\'re awfulFor context sure, but fair warning, the movie isn\\'t good, the show is excellent though.Only like the first half of the movie is relevant to the show. After it introduces Ashoka nothing important really happens.The movie and the 1st season of the show are pretty terrible. (The movie is just 4 episodes of season 1 spliced together).The show is okay in season 2...ish.Seasons 3-7 and really where it gets really good.Honestly, as a first time watcher I\\'d almost argue watching in release order. Watching again, absolutely, but there are some elements that might confuse abit watching chronologically. You get actual character introductions at different points in a case or two, for one thing.I just looked at some their catalog, and this honestly feels like 2017 Netflix since they kinda have all the necessities. Also, Disney and Nickelodeon on the same streaming service? Lucky!The movie and the 1st season of the show are pretty terrible. (The movie is just 4 episodes of season 1 spliced together). The show is okay in season 2...ish.Seasons 3-7 and really where it gets really good.There are also a couple episodes that appear before it chronologically, but for first time viewing, I\\'d agree to watch the movie first.That’s a legit point, but it aggravated me to no end that one of the episodes seemingly had no follow up, only to find out that it was the intro into the movie.Here in the middle east, we don’t have the fragmentation of the streaming services the US has. We will reach there but like many years in the future. So you are right. For example, we don’t have HBO max so friends and studio Ghibli catalogue are on netflix. We don’t have disney plus or hulu and most of their content is on starz.are you saying i should watch 3-7?I agree the first season is definitely the weakest though there are some standouts like rookies which is one of the best of the seriesIt\\'s odd until you know that yeah, and from the context, it does set up for the movie well enough, it doesn\\'t outright tell you though.Well then, enjoy it while it lasts.I actually enjoy seasons 1 and 2. They’re certainly good, just not on the level of 3-7. I’d say watch it anyway. It makes you appreciate the later stuff moreYou should absolutely watch all the way through once. 1 and 2 have some good bits, they\\'re just a bit more kid focused and semi-campy. They shifted the feel of the show abit in the later seasons, giving it more depth, but it\\'s all still canon and a good experience.No, you should watch some of season one. Avoid the duel of the droids and Jar Jar episodes and you should be fineI wouldnt say it\\'s the best, but it gives us Fives and Echo, and is a solid episode.It\\'s important for the story too. You can get the cliffnotes, but watching the earlier seasons gives you a good ramp-up.Most shows usually debut on D+ around 1-2 months after their season finales, so it\\'ll probably debut in April or May.It\\'s on Netflix in the Disney Short Film Collection.Not available. I don’t know the backstory.Do you mean Before Ever After? It\\'s been on there for awhile now along with the movie, the series and the series shorts.Probably a contractual issue then...Tangled: Ever After and Tangled: Before Ever After are two different shorts.I can\\'t imagine that contract will last too much longer, it\\'s been on there since October 25, 2015.Hey, I did this and did a full break down...search for the thread... unfortunately no promoSub to the Hulu Disney ESPN bundle, then change Hulu to ad free.   They\\'ll credit you $6 every monththats only worth it if you want ESPN, as youd be paying $12.99-$5.99 discount for paying for Hulu separately-$3.92 discount for Disney+ leaving you with paying a monthly $3.08 for ESPN, $11.99 for Hulu, and whatever you paid for the Disney+ multiyear plan upfront.Thank you.So the monthly bill will be around $13/month for this bundle(after credits)?The title is misleading. It’s in the US too.Yeah but maleficent two came out a month before. Why not drop that too? and throw in Star wars and then you\\'re really doing some good deedsI’m assuming it’s not going to be on the UK version since the dvd doesn’t come out until the end of March.It\\'s actually available Sunday March 15 in the US.Sorry! I had noticed that there was already a post about the US release...Because Maleficent doesn’t push sales.Yes.Ah, all good! :)That\\'s true, but it would earn more good press.Mine works fine, probably something wrong with you TVThis happened at first with my new LG tv.  I had to unplug the tv for 60 seconds and plug it back in.  Also make sure your 4K settings are set up properly.Are other people having this problem?I\\'m getting video but no audio in Star Wars Episode II, and everything else I try has narrator descriptions but I can\\'t change the audio track off of default (in Roku). Works properly on my phone.I know this sounds dumb but check your tv settings. And try a different input for your fire stick. My fire stick didn’t fit snug (properly) in HDMI2 but HDMI1 works fine.No, everything else works perfectly fineIf they release D+ early in UK with all their library. The chances are very high that Sky will sue their asses to dirt.Thats true I forgot my bad thx u just thinking with everything going on could they not do a deal? 😀[deleted]Because they legally can’t show the stuff that Now Tv has the rights too so that’s all the Disney films, Star Wars stuff and marvel stuff.[deleted]On March 24th Disney+ gets those. Look at the library list dude.No u would on the 24th of this month 😀An theres more than that list to 😀Gonna binge the hell out of the Clone Wars and Rebels.Nice im gonna binge x men and fantastic fourXmen animated series for me. All about the theme songYes hopefully x men evolution an wolverine and the x men will be on thereIt willYes. Here’s the tweetI assume you aren\\'t in the US because Infinity War is still on Netflix here.If you’re in a country that has Infinity War, it should be in there, maybe they forgot to update it since here in the US we don’t have Infinity War yet, and they just made one list for all countries.Im in Canada. We have it on Netflix and Disney+Other companies are doing the same. Apple TV has delayed The Morning Show. Good for them.Disney Plus apps will be available on, and after, launch day.As of 90 days ago (still true afik), Sony has announced no planned support to add D+ to their UBPs that I am aware of as (I work closely with liaisons, though I do not work for Sony). In fact, it seems that more and more bluray players are losing apps or even shipping without them. It\\'s clear that the platform-based apps are going to be the future. Android TV, Roku, Fire, Apple -- services that do not require app updates on a per-model basis. And Sony has a great quality UBP that runs terrible software (Gracenote) with barely any apps on it.TLDR Don\\'t count on it. Buy a Roku Ultra, Shield TV, or Apple TV.Thanks, appreciate itWhich country are you in and with which movies/series have you experienced this?USA and I’ve tried with several shows (Star vs the forces of evil, simpsons, the mandalorian, ect) and movies (animated and live action) and a few documentaries from the Nat Geo collectionThis looks like a problem for... *Customer Service!*Thought so! Just wanted to double check here firstWhat? They were always English.I believe the issue was the opening crawl was in French for some Canadians.^Ahhh. I did not know that.This is actually a good question.As far as older content goes, it depends on what was/is available. For instance, \"Tangled\" came out in Germany with German subs AND dubs, but it could be that some National Geographic series will only have subtitles and no German dubbing. The original language with subtitles should always be available, but at this point there\\'s no guarantee and texts in videos may be only available in the local language, even when the audio is in English.I sometimes like to look at what languages are there, just to see what has what. I observed on the US Disney+: * Sometimes different seasons of a show have different languages for some reason. This may just be being updated as it\\'s being worked on? * \"Originals\" seem to have all their languages all ready to go* Newer - think 2010s DCOMs seem to mostly have German - older ones seem to be hit/miss. * Disney Channel shows seem to have German.* Frozen II was put up 3 months early due to Corona Virus - it only has English (+ description and subs). * A big thing - regardless of language - you only get 1 audio track OR that track *and* the descriptive track for those with bad eyesight per language.    * Spanish and French *may* have North American and European tracks. I know some Disney and Star Wars fans like specific versions but ¯\\\\\\\\\\\\_(ツ)\\\\_/¯As an American living in Germany, I have often found on other streaming services that original German programming rarely has English subtitles and few additional language tracks. Sometimes, American films are only released as dubbed with German actors. I don\\'t want to go in on the price for Disney+ and find the movies we want to see are only in German. So... i was expecting to have disney classics in several languages..to my surprise...some classics like Lion King or Frozen are missing languages... My wife is french and like to watcu disney in French.. we live in germany.. and many titles are missing french Language as well as subtitles.....we will wait a couple of months than we will stop the subscription for sure.... Disney titles on disney platforms should have all european languages in europe...Wdym best and worst ending?It was excellent and did not disappoint. I needed some happy tears to balance out my stress from these cRaZy times we\\'re having.Grace Vanderwaal was an excellent choice for the character.I really enjoyed it too. There couldn\\'t have been a better time for such an uplifting, soulful movie to come out. Today and Tomorrow plays during the credits and there is a short clip of Stargirl and Leo.I liked Star Girl a lot. Beginning not so much, but loved it after the football game moment.I watched True Confessions right after because I liked it when it was on Disney Channel years ago. Watch it if you have not yet. I liked it more this time.Apparently Paramount owns the rights to the film currentlyBut wouldn\\'t that potentially kill home video sales?They released Frozen II early because of this exact reason.  Now you\\'re just being greedy.Maybe if they did it as little instalments like “Forky Asks A Question” but with each episode driving an ongoing narrative.I would definitely enjoy catching a weekly episode featuring our boy Frozone!\"Where\\'s my super suit?\"I don\\'t want Pixar to waste energy on sequels unless they truly have an amazing ideaThe kids in the middle and on the right remind me of the kids from Emperors New GrooveI’m down but please use the comics as a template. Oh my god they’re so good and I don’t wanna lose all the development the kids are getting in themI dunno, Frozone and his wife give off the vibe that they don’t have kids.Cute pic but I think it would be weird if Frozone had superpowered kids that weren\\'t seen or mentioned before. His wife already didn\\'t seem too crazy about him heroing.Where is my Super Suit!?Just give it to Bruce W. Smith.The wife looks like an animated Tiffany HaddishNah, I\\'m good. I like Frozone, but I don\\'t think an entire TV show based around his family would work the same way The Incredibles does.Why?Yeah a short limited series.Frozone has kids? KANPAI!What about a Disney plus series!I never pictured IHis wife like that from her lines in the movie.Or a 25 minute weekly series.Why did I think that was Kobe BryantThis could work.  For the greater good.And make majority of the soundtrack earth wind and fire lol.   I\\'m already picturing September in the trailer lolAll his kids were born in September because they\\'re Earth Wind and FireWhat is up with the girls hair on the left with the fire power? Are those supposed to be dreads because yikes.I prefer original ideasThought it was a Bebe’s Kids crossover at firstI’ll be all in if one kid goes full todorokiI wouldn’t mind it as a short either!Why. Do you. Want. To know!?!this is a truly amazing ideaI\\'m sorry I can\\'t hear you over the plans for Toy Story 5, 6, 7I don’t want Pixar basically copying Avatar.comics?! where can i find these?i dunno... didn\\'t she complain about planning a dinner date weeks or months in advance when he was looking for his super suit?      planning a date that far in advance doesn\\'t sound like something a childless couple would have to do...    source: used to not have kid, now have kidShe may not have been too crazy about it because “he was setting a bad example for the kids”. Maybe the kids had powers but moms said that “powers” are not to be used, hence why dad doesn’t use his, but when he comes out of retirement to help the kids see Dad and all he’s able to do and start to experiment with their own powers.I wouldn’t mind seeing it as a quick short tbhWhy notBecause blackIt\\'s a headband.r/moviescirclejerkYeah.  Like short 5-10 min clips of day to day life.  Baseball game, grocery store, dinner time.  Endless possibilities.I need it!Is it? In my opinion Incedibles 2 was not an amazing idea, it was generic and kinda boring to me. So why would I want to see a spin off of that? What the story? Who is the villian? Wouldn\\'t it just be an other incredibles movies becuase just Frozone doesnt sell merch?Pretty generic boring idea. Could be a good tv show tho. Why not avengers crossover with the incredible?Sadly you missed a really good sale on comiXology a few weeks ago but they’re all available in trade form as well as individual issues if you wanna for whatever reason spend more money lol.I highly recommend checking out all the current incredibles 2 comics as secret identities and the current story slow burn are my favorites so far. The others are cute too but the stories in these are for lack of better wording, incredible 😉.Honestly, secret identities has a story I WISH superhero shows would tackle. It’s such a ridiculously important topic I don’t remember ever being covered in all my years watching them.Enjoy 😁Edit: https://m.comixology.com/Disney-PIXAR-The-Incredibles-2/comics-series/118875?ref=c2VhcmNoL2luZGV4L21vYmlsZS9zbGlkZXJMaXN0L3Nlcmllc1NsaWRlcgFor anyone lookin to buy 😁Maybe the other people at the planned dinner party have kids and that was the only time they could get together?Their kids are never mentioned in the first movie, though. This looks nice in fan art but just doesn’t sound like a good story.Kind of reminds me of the really old Simpsons shorts, on the Tracey Ullman showLike what they used to do with Roger Rabbit.yeah incredibles 2 wasnt great. but i think people are saying they want this because they like the character of frozone and want to see more of him. might work better as  a shortwhat’s this unique story/topic?100 percent agree that it could be a short. I would love that. Better than a Simpsons short infront of a Pixar movieI’d love it as a TV seriesWell, hopefully this spoiler tag works just in case but basically >!in secret identities, Violet makes a new friend. Someone at school like her. They share laughs and have lots of fun together and are happy to have someone that understands them. However, while Violet has the support and love of her family by her side, not everyone is so lucky to have a loving home life. !< BUT THE BEST PART IS THAT’S NOT EVEN THE REASON THIS STORY IS SO GOOD! I can’t spoil it even with tags but let’s just say we don’t leave this story in a typical bad guy fashion. There is a twist to the story that made me genuinely impressed and immediately hooked on the idea that this series needs an animated version and I’d be ok with it so long as these guys wrote it.yeah, that short should\\'ve been a couch gag or something. pixar really has lost its soul.Hehe, soulI\\'m pretty sure Pixar had no say in that Simpsons short. Not like they\\'re the ones animating that.Hell, they probably didn\\'t even know there was one being shown in the first place.yeah, im glad someone caught that one :)i know, but the movie that showed after it wasnt as good as pixar used to bePixar has had worse films; not every one of them can be winners.yeah, hopefully soul will be betterMissing bonus features that were on the home releases is an issue for nearly every movie on the service.So you still have to buy the dvdWhatBuy, sorryI agree! Of the 10 classic cartoons that we got in the Netherlands only Steamboat Willie is in black and white. Would love to see more of those!I tried to find info about B&W cartoons and honestly have wondered how many there actually are and am curious if they were B&W because they were shown on old TV sets and recorded like that or if the cartoons were actually in color.&#x200B;Couldn\\'t find much info. :(The only time all of the BW Mickey cartoons were released was via Disney Treasures, but they\\'re out of print now.What kind of cartoons and shorts are on the service anyway? I’ve long been waiting for a chance to watch those old 30s-50s Disney cartoons (Donald, Mickey, goofy, silly symphonies)There are at least 74 of them.  Though not always the best source Wikipedia has a pretty good list of the cartoons. It\\'s a good starting point at least.[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey\\\\_Mouse\\\\_(film\\\\_series)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Mouse_(film_series))Most are in black and white actually.It depends where you live. Is this the US or another English-speaking market? Then you can expect a selection of 30-60 classic cartoons to which cartoons are added regularly. Do you live in another country? Then you’re out of luck and will end up with only 10 cartoons. That’s the way it has been for the past four months in the Netherlands at least.Thank you so much.Crazy, I would have thought they would be in color regardless but I guess it makes sense considering the medium. :)Germany :(Well BW Mickey cartoons came out before colour ones did and by the time Mickey was in colour, he was too innocent to do much with.Disney is watching you jerk itTo what? 😂Nah to AshokaSteamboat WillieHahaha hell yeahRecently, Disney plus icon started reflecting on the Hotstar application indicating its arrival in India almost 18 days ahead of schedule.>\\tHowever, within 24 hours of its release, Hotstar rolled back Disney + for its Indian users. According to a Hindustan Times report, Hotstar in a statement clarified that the availability of Disney+ content was part of a beta trial with limited number of users and the official launch is still fixed for 29 March, 2020.>\\t“A limited release of the beta version of the Disney+ Hotstar app is currently being tested with a small number of consumers, in preparation for the full-fledged app launch on 29th March,\" a Hotstar spokesperson told Hindustan Times following the availability of Disney+ content in India.>\\tFor a limited period, users in India got a blue theme to mark the arrival of Disney Plus. The website, however, still followed the same colour scheme.>\\tBut, as it was a beta trial, a lot of users on Twitter highlighted that the content of Disney Plus had vanished and they naturally seemed to be quite dissatisfied with the roll back.>\\tWith the launch of Disney Plus Hotstar in India, Netflix has a direct competitor who has a wide array of international labels under its belt. Last month, Netflix stopped offering the first month for free to new users. However, the company later came up with a ₹5 subscription plan for a few new users. The new plan was launched as a trial and is not available to all first-time users.>\\tSo far, the pricing of Disney Plus Hotstar is the same at ₹999 a year and ₹299 a month. Netflix on the other hand has multiple monthly plans starting at ₹199 (only mobile) and goes all the way up to ₹799.Early 2020 is still for another 3.5 months. But I doubt it\\'s a priority now given with everything going on.Nope. It won’t happen for a bit, they’re not focusing on it now.I hope you’re right about this!I’m still waiting for Cheaper by the Dozen 2I\\'m guessing one of those Fantastic Fours is Fant4stic, right?Mighty ducks in June and mighty ducks 2 and 3 in January 2021Do you know if a similar list is available for the Netherlands? Would be great to know if we will ever get the many titles that the US got at launch and are being kept away from us simple non-Americans.Already have most of those on the Canada D+How are you finding this information?  Is it on the public internet?added some important new info in the EDIT above :)It\\'s the 16th and sadly  X-Men The Last Stand is not on disney+ yetWell, based on the list of \"Coming in April\" none of the dates worked out from now till May 1st unless they end up being  surprise adds. Sad. Although I did say the ones that are closest were the least likely to be accurate.Unfortunately, just because they’re leaving a service at some point, does not mean Disney+ is their next homesometimes they have predicting deals to go to one or more services after the one it’s currently on.Fox titles especially are less guaranteed as those have been added and then pulled as soon as a month later, and back onto another service or not available to stream at all.Only when the date it ends on it’s current service coincides with the Disney+ add date do we know for sure that will be its next home, but even then we don’t know how long it’ll be on Disney+.I had been under the impression that the whole reason those titles had dates of when they’d be added was that once it got added it had completed any contractual obligations elsewhere and would permanently remain in Disney+. Sadly we now know that is not the case as some movies have been added only to be removed again, and most often without even its next return date.The only exception I’ve seen so far has been Alice through the poking glass which is set to return in 2022.But any other movie that has left does not have a new return date, some have since been added back again, like Finest Hours, some have been added back only to be removed again, like sandlot, and others have been removed and stayed gone and no next return date, like pirates of the Caribbean on stranger tides. Fox titles in particular never seen to have a title page announcing what day it’ll be added, probably because of the preexisting Fox contracts that Disney has no control over. They just add a Fox movie when they can and remove it once they can no longer have it. I’ve heard 2022 being the time once Fox contracts expire so maybe then we will see more Fox titles on Disney+ and with more permanence.What gives me hope is I compared it against a lot of the existing placeholders for HBO and starz movies and found that they were showing the same expiration date on the spectrum site so that suggests that some of these should be accurate too.Oh I forgot to check that one!July 1st, 2020 :)Indeed,.Yep but we knew those already 😄Doubtful. One of our major cable companies in America is called spectrum and this is available on their website. I honestly can\\'t believe it because for the HBO titles it appears to be accurate and I have never heard anywhere that HBO shares their expiration dates of content but this appears to be the answers.OP literally said this in the post and stated the reason why it\\'s not yet available in the US. Preexisting agreements.Spectrum movies site shows expirations for each video. I wasn\\'t even logged in so I don\\'t think you have to be a subscriber.I noticed. :( It expired at IFC but now moved to AMCOh, yeah. I\\'m aware of all of this stuff :) I mentioned above with regards to the ones on television deals they tend to go from one to another location or stay and go through periods of being available or unavailable. I also noticed last year that the landing pages are never for Fox titles. I wish they had negotiated with HBO and got that stupid deal to end sooner, Disney Plus will be way better when they truly have full access to their titles. They should have waited to launch until 2023, launched with double the library for the same price they have now, and just obliterated the competition.By the way, Sandlot 2 is going to Starz mid month of April so I bet it leaves... just like Sandlot. Fox titles are highly susceptible to fluctuation. Same with the Garfields. The Alice situation is very bad news for us as it means, inexplicably, they were still setting up huge longterm deals even AFTER the 1.5 years at Netflix deal. My only hope is that they used Alice as a bartering tool to give TNT / TBS a title in place of exclusivity deals with the Star Wars titles. I am speculating this is the same situation with On Stranger Tides ( [https://www.tntdrama.com/movies/pirates-of-the-caribbean-on-stranger-tides](https://www.tntdrama.com/movies/pirates-of-the-caribbean-on-stranger-tides) ).\" And if Disney wants the *Star Wars* movies in the library of their upcoming streaming service, they want to be financially compensated, and they also want programming to replace those films if they were to give them up. \"See:  [https://www.slashfilm.com/star-wars-tv-rights/](https://www.slashfilm.com/star-wars-tv-rights/)Maybe not everyone did I was just letting those who didn’t knowOh oopsCould you give a link? I tried looking online and their video on demand website doesn\\'t show me expiration dates. I don\\'t have any Spectrum services.http://www.spectrumondemand.com/movies/IIRC, a lighting cable can\\'t transfer HDCP protected video.You can’t just use a charging cable to stream video. Do you have the Lightning-to-AV adapter?Why not? It works fine for YouTube and whatever else I want to project from my phone but it won\\'t work with only Disney plusThat isn\\'t how HDCP content works. Don\\'t get mad because you don\\'t understand why it doesn\\'t work the way you think it should.Sorry dude I’m just looking for an explanation. What is hdcp content?Digitally copy protected.  It is so you can\\'t just hook it up to a digital source and copy it.  If it wasn\\'t enforced you could copy anything on Disney+ to a flash drive after you watched it once.I watched it this morning (was up early from acid reflux, and couldn\\'t sleep). It was pretty good. I, personally wouldn\\'t go with 10 out of 10, but would give it maybe a soft 7 out of 10. But it\\'s a nice, \"feel-good\" movie that\\'s nice to see while you\\'re hiding away in your toilet paper fort you cleared the shelves at the local store to make.TMIIts the full price for 1 year.Thank you.Wait a bitI and my friends would love to see the old 1950s TV Shows and movies from the vault ie: **Texas John Slaughter, Elfego Baca, Swamp Fox, Saga of Andy Burnette, Daniel Boone** or any of these that were released as films, made from those shows. The series themselves would be great with the Walt Disney openings.Technically Disney never officially announced that Zorro was coming to D+ today.Yep got up this morning ready to watch zorro and still nothing. Hoping it still releases today.I was stoked to watch it today too.The day’s not over yet.Zorro tested positive for Coronavirus... so it\\'ll be a few months at least.&#x200B;:P  Edit: Disney has comedies you know! sheesh! :PNot coming. Yet again they blew it. What a disappointment this service is. https://twitter.com/disneyplus/status/1238524961616101376?s=09Yes they did. Season 1So like 5pm? 6pm? What\\'s their official release time for stuff like this.I mean it\\'s literally their announcement of what came out today. They release it every Friday and it doesn\\'t include the content that didn\\'t show up yet which means it\\'s not coming until next week or later. Just like last week\\'s didn\\'t have three on the run and then it never showed up either.oh no the bootlickers downvoted me again for having valid opinionsI understand that part. But it wasn\\'t in the video they post to social media at the beginning of each month.I don’t think there’s an official announced time. If there was, they’d list it somewhere.It got postponed because of coronavirus, they don’t want huge family gatherings at home70% wasnt[removed]I think you\\'re trollingNo one on here works for D+ so your guess is as good as mine.This sounds like a **technical issue**.Please give some technical details (app type, error, other details of the playback device) if you need help.I downloaded the app off my tv App Store, the app works fine, i just can’t play the videos and shows. No error sign comes up. When i go to play (for example) captain America, the movies will load, and then just go to a black screen. I can’t skip or anything. This happens for every movie and showWhat kind of tv (and in which country) and could it be that your router is the issue?It could be the bandwidth, or even a firewall issue, causing the app to give a timeout after trying.The app will be available upon launch. Not before.Thanks, that\\'s all I needed to know.as someone who read the book when I was younger I hope the movie is as goodNever read the book, but the film was cute, sweet and had a great message. Grace Vanderwaal is the perfect lead and the music in it was awesome as well. It reminded me of a 1980\\'s John Hughes film. Highly recommended family viewing for those of us currently practicing social distancing (which is pretty much everyone).Still waiting on Zorro. I also noticed Wicked Tuna hadn\\'t added the rest of the seasons yet and that Wicked Tuna Outer Banks has no episodes, just a landing page. They\\'re still not quite there.... Netflix doesn\\'t do these weird \"half-launches\" of new content.Of you don\\'t see the Chromecast icon ,means that you can not cast it using iPhoneChrome cast is an option, but whenever I try my TV stays on a grey screen as it’s ‘connecting’ and then it just loses connection after a extended period of timeTried after connecting, to play something?Auto play stops after a couple of episodes to force user input. This is to prevent people from using Disney+ as a background display, &c.Finally! I just said to my boys last night, “when is Season 2 gonna be added?”But have the episodes been put in the proper order?Ah-WOO-ooI literally just finished season 2 last night on some other cartoon streaming site cause I was binging it initially on disney plus.... guess I\\'ll just do it all over againNow the episodes just have to be in order and we’ll be set!Great that we have something to watch while the parks are closed.For real. I’ve been waiting to watch this show since D+ launched but I can’t deal with the missing episodes!Nice, but when do we in the Netherlands finally get:- The Rescuers- Bonkers- TaleSpin- About 50 classic cartoons that are available in other markets- Lizzie McGuire- Hercules series- The Emperor’s New School- Mickey’s Christmas Carol- A Kid in King Arthur’s Court- Flight of the Navigator- My Dog, the Thief- Mickey Mouse Club (1955)- The Adventures of Spin and Marty- Disneyland Through the SeasonsMost of these titles are not under contract anywhere and have been available in the US since launch. We are treated as second class customers by Disney... extremely disappointing.Are any of the X-Men films in 4k?Wonder when this will happen in the USGekoloniseerdIs Once Upon A Deadpool on there since its PG-13Completely agree! I\\'m from the UK and a lot of these aren\\'t on there for us either.From what I can tell all of them besides X-Men Origins: WolverineWhen hbo and Starz step the heck aside. Probably 2022 or later.Unfortunately noDo\\'h!Wondering the same thing! We really wanted to watch it this morning and it’s still not on there.Is there even a reliable list that\\'s saying the release dates?All I know is I can’t waitOh man I want to know too! It’s one of the reasons I got D+!This is the first time hearing about it. I cant wait to see it now.Pretty sure i saw a leak a while back that said it was Mayish?Tell me about it! I just recently finished a run through the  renaissance era films and it never ceases to amaze me how incredible those Ashman/Menken tunes are. Can\\'t wait to learn more about the former.Have you watched Waking Sleeping Beauty yet? They talk about him a lot in it.Oh yes, many times! I live for this historical Disney stuff. The Imagineers story was amazing as well. My list now has the Ashman one, the Sherman Bros one, and the untitled Mickey one from the director of the recent Mr. Rogers doc. Too much good stuff!Sorry for the self plug, but if you\\'re interested in learning about Ashman, I did a video essay of the history of his work and its potential relationship to queerness: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euXi03tGoDE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euXi03tGoDE)I\\'m looking forward to the documentary as well!Coronavirus has screwed the House of Mouse so much that it has infected its streaming service.Is this a dolby vision problem perhaps?Disney psychedelics.It’s a roku 4k HDR flatscreen but the tv shows on Disney+ work perfectly fine it’s only the movies that look like this, and there wasn’t too many display settings either for me to test around withExactly, I told my sister keep it like that and me n my brother in law are gonna take some acid and watch movies with this effect. Will keep you guys posted. 👌It\\'s a Roku 4k hooked up to a 4K display, or it\\'s a Roku TV that supports 4K?If it\\'s hooked up externally, check your HDMI cable. It likely does not support the proper bandwidth, OR it might not be plugged in fully, OR it might be damaged.If it\\'s a Roku TV, look for a firmware update from the manufacturer or e-mail their support.I understand that already.  Could this be a dolby vision problem?  Are the movies you\\'re watching dolby vision?  Are the TV shows you\\'re watching dolby vision?😂😂😂Just checked, yeah all the Dolby shows have the effect on it, even on NetflixThen this isn\\'t a Disney+ problem or a Netflix problem.You need to search for a fix for your model TV.ThanksHow do these X-men films show up in the Marvel hub? Like are they listed in the same line as the MCU films?Any word on when these movies are coming to U.S.?Does anyone like how clean all these collections work?Where’s x men evolution and wolverine and the x men?I’m starting to think American Disney+ is complete garbage now. All these other countries have more adult content and Fox properties and in America we only have one Ice Age movie, some Fox properties, and obviously we don’t have any adult content that’s Fox related.yeah they\\'re mixed in with the MCU and the Fantastic Four moviesIt’s not going to be until a long time unfortunately... with Hulu being an American thing and the fact that Fox has all these deals with companies in America, Disney+ won’t have a vibrant library until 2023. Other countries don’t have Hulu and they also don’t have the deals so that’s why all these movies are on the service without trouble.>  more adult content Other countries don\\'t have adult content. In Canada, we have many Fox movies including all the Ice Age movies and most of the X-Men movies but none of the Disney+ libraries have anything that\\'s above PG-13 or TV-14.You\\'re KIDDING me, right? UK Disney+ is much worse and it isn\\'t even out yet! Americans already get the vast majority of content already, so why can\\'t you just wait a few years to stream a few Movies that have DVD/Blu-Ray releases? Some of the content that\\'s region locked as American exclusive, never got a single DVD/Blu-Ray release. We\\'re forced to never be allowed to watch them ever, because we were born in the wrong country and have to MOVE 1000s of miles to be seen as equals!An extremely short-sighted view. You know that you will get this content eventually, it just takes some time. Look at the long list (growing every week!) of classic Disney content that ‘all these other countries’ will probably never get:- The Rescuers- Bonkers- TaleSpin- About 50 classic cartoons that are available in other markets- Lizzie McGuire- Hercules series- The Emperor’s New School- Mickey’s Christmas Carol- A Kid in King Arthur’s Court- Flight of the Navigator- My Dog, the Thief- Mickey Mouse Club (1955)- The Adventures of Spin and Marty- Disneyland Through the SeasonsBe happy with what you have... Disney gave you the better deal BY FAR.Seems like that would be confusing.They should separate it into a row for the “Marvel Cinematic Universe” and “Legacy Marvel Movies” or something like that.Doesn\\'t Disney own Hulu?Don’t be disappointed. At least you KNOW that you will eventually get these movies. Look at the below list of classic Disney material that was mostly available at launch in the US, but was kept off Disney+ in the Netherlands. The probability that we will ever see this content becomes smaller every week. I’d say you in the US have the better deal by far!- The Rescuers- Bonkers- TaleSpin- About 50 classic cartoons that are available in other markets- Lizzie McGuire- Hercules series- The Emperor’s New School- Mickey’s Christmas Carol- A Kid in King Arthur’s Court- Flight of the Navigator- My Dog, the Thief- Mickey Mouse Club (1955)- The Adventures of Spin and Marty- Disneyland Through the SeasonsMost of these titles are not under contract anywhere and have been available in the US since launch. We are treated as second class customers by Disney... extremely disappointing.In the Netherlands, they\\'re in a row named \"More Marvel Movies\".They used to but they changed itYeah, I\\'m sick of Americans complaining about what they don\\'t get yet. They already have 90%+ of all the Disney+ content, the rest of us get what, 70% max?Everyone is lucky except for America :(I\\'m still waiting for this movie to get the mass appreciation and recognition it deserves. Loved it.Does Disney own Peanuts? Is Peanuts on Disney Plus and I just haven\\'t looked?So this The Peanuts movie is on here. it\\'s made by Blue Sky. So my only question is when is Spies in Disguise coming? Considering it\\'s made by the same studio.You\\'re kidding me, right? You get 6 exclusive classic Disney cartoon series, that the rest of the world isn\\'t even ALLOWED to watch. Additionally, the US also gets Bonkers, a show that got 0 releases outside of the 90s and that was on VHS ONLY! No-one else can even WATCH that show in it\\'s entirety.I understand how you got that point of view, but I\\'m with the other person. One area i\\'d like to add that we\\'re really lacking in is the old Disney shorts. I think we\\'ve only got like 10 of them over here sadly.The Peanuts Movie was made by Blue Sky Studios. which is owned by FOX. which Disney owns nowDisney doesn\\'t have the rights to the Peanuts specialsDang I’m sorry, I didn’t even know that :( that sucks. I hope Disney releases all those for the rest of the world as I’m not sure why it’s only in America. Is it licensing issues?Wait, i thought Bonkers was available in Australia? I’m not in the country right now so i can’t verify but I swear I saw it in there.What are the six exclusive series the US has? I Googled but couldn’t find anything.I meant the animated series aside from the specials, but thanks!It can\\'t be due to licensing issues. It\\'s probably some dumb EULA stuff, where a certain % of shows have to be made in the EU, so they cut some random cartoons they thought no-one would notice. The UK is actually slightly better than the rest of Europe, because we get 2 shows they don\\'t get. Though I actually bought the service for Bonkers, so I\\'m more than a little salty.Then that means no-one in the EU can have it, which is still region locking.https://uk.ign.com/articles/disney-plus-announces-full-content-line-up-for-the-ukIt lists the shows we get.Thank you :). Aside from Bonkers, what are the properties you most want on the service that won’t be there at launch? I think it’s weird how you only have one season of Rapunzel’s Tangled Adventure when it’s already done and dusted. Disney doesn’t do the greatest job of advertising they’ve added new content to the service unless it’s a huge moneymaker (I just found out Kazam is on there through sheer dumb luck). I hope they eventually add what you want to see!Here is a list of content that Disney is keeping away from viewers in the Netherlands: most of it was available in the US at launch.- The Rescuers- Bonkers- TaleSpin- Doug- About 50 classic cartoons that are available in other markets- Lizzie McGuire- Hercules series- The Emperor’s New School- Mickey’s Christmas Carol- A Kid in King Arthur’s Court- Flight of the Navigator- My Dog, the Thief- Mickey Mouse Club (1955)- The Adventures of Spin and Marty- I Captured the King of the Leprechauns- Disneyland Through the SeasonsThere may be a valid reason for making all this content unavailable, but Disney refuses to give any explanation, apart from the old ‘existing contracts’ excuse. Which is total NONSENSE for most of the titles listed (do you seriously expect the 1955 Mickey Mouse Club being streamed anywhere else)?I\\'m suspicious about it.We need more Preeschool shows in general. A lot of the good ones like Stanley and Bear in the Big Blue House aren\\'t even on.This was my favorite, i can\\'t even find the swedish intro online (I\\'m swedish)I was wondering the same thing too when I first looked through Disney Plus. I figured they’d be on there Day 1 since, as far as I know, they premiered on ABC. Hopefully they put those two specials on there soon enough, along with Buzz Lightyear of Star Command, least this way we can have the Complete Toy Story Collection,Right now, they seem to hold those holiday specials like those and Prep and Landing for TV airings.Yeah from what I’ve heard, Disney doesn’t have any deals with those properties so I’m not sure what’s taking so long for these animations to be on the service. I guess they’re just waiting for the right moment?Yeah, I was wondering about Prep & Landing as well. C\\'mon, Disney+, how about another special with Lanny and Wayne?!Maybe? They are both holiday specials, so I guess they’re waiting for Halloween and Christmas. Buuuut if that’s the case, why would they add Mickey’s Christmas Carol in March??It wouldn\\'t be cool. At all.They could call it.... YOU\\'VE BEEN FRAMED or somethingEh. We have YouTube for that.Couldn\\'t care less.They\\'d call it \"caring in the slightest\".please no CurrentTV was bad enough.about 4 months after it\\'s released on home video, so probably around July or August.6 months after it releases on Blu Ray. So, August?\"I want to watch it again,\"That\\'s like asking for another round of waterboarding.Does anyone care?When does Mandalorian Season 2 get here?It’s actually 6-7 months after theatrical release, or 3-4 after home media release. So it goes theatrical release, 3-4 months later: home media release, with digital 2 weeks before the physical options. And then 3-4 weeks after that it finally becomes available to stream. I would expect it sometime in July. Frozen 2 which came out just before TROS just got a release date of June 26 for Disney+At least in the U.S., it should the 12-16 weeks after home video release (6-8 months after theatrical release), so more like mid-June to July. Other countries may vary.I would say July 24 based on the Frozen 2 model. Who knows if it will hold.It hasnt released for home video yet (digital is 3/17). Six months from then is actually September, tbh.It’s not always an exact science cuz Toy Story 4 came out before Lion King (2019) both theatrically and on home media but Lion King (2019) was added to Disney+ before Toy Story 4Samantha??I picked it up on Blu-ray and I think my daughter has watched it 10x already if not moregood now i\\'m waiting for that documentary.Is there a date for the Rise Of Skywalker yet?10 July in the Netherlands (might be the first time that the US receive a title before the Netherlands, if I recall correctly)I can hear you but I won\\'t...Ahhhhhh-ahhh-ah-ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhJust in time for quarantine.Too late. Already bought it because I have a four year old.This news aged like a cut up apple left in sunlight.Thats too far away. I want it NOW. 😡[deleted]This is the wayThat was quickAlready?!?Noice, my kid will love itGood to know! We bought this on digital and we’ve already watched it several times. Well worth it but make sure you have some tissues with you, I cried several times 🤦🏻\\u200d♀\\u200dJune?!! I’m sorry but that sucks for subscribers. I love Disney, but they are doing very little to grow the platform with steady content.Yes! Can’t wait!I’ve been looking forward to thisI didn\\'t watch it in theaters but maybe I\\'ll check it out when it comes out on Disney+.I watched the first Frozen when it first came out on Blu-Ray and I thought it was ok. I liked Anna and Elsa\\'s character arcs but not much else. It felt like the only reason there were any other characters in the movie is because there needed to be comic relief somewhere and you can\\'t get it from Anna or Elsa. Maybe a little bit from Anna but only before her plot really gets going.Great! I had no intentions on watching this in the theater but will definitely watch it on D+[removed]IMHO these movies take way too long to show up on these platforms. If at first it was the fractured streaming market that started the push back to more piracy, the delays will continue to do that as well. I\\'m not condoning it, but speaking my frustration for the seemingly meaningless delays.Thanks for the heads up! Can\\'t wait to do a series rewatch once Into the Unknown releases alongside this.Streaming services the true mvp. Gonna keep me real occupied during corona sznOh what! It’s available from July 31st in Australia, not fair hahaUgh! This was a horrible movie! The plot was crappy, the music scenes were soooo cringey. Not even my little nieces found it amusing.Should have came out when it was released on disc.There\\'s a Frozen 2? :]“I don’t even know a Samantha!”My wife is Samantha.She used to love this line from the movie.Used to....In the German version it was ‘Hildegard’, which sounded really random 😂😂I bought it on digital because my wife said we didn\\'t need another blu ray and then everyone decided we can\\'t live without the special features so I bought the 4K Blu Ray combo from Target too. I\\'m an idiot. But, we too have gotten our money\\'s worth. It\\'s about 10 cents per showing at this point I think.But I wish D+ had the special features with movies, the deleted scenes, etc.Bought it for myself the day it released, I’ve watched it almost every night so far. There’s no way I could’ve waited until June!Ditto. Money well spent though.What documentary?Nothing yet but it’ll probably be end of JulyWill we make it that far as a society?Lion king (2019) was later herejust buy it on digitalSame date as the US apparentlySame date. June 26th.This is probably one of the best Disney sequels. Top 5 for me. It’s hard to explain everything I love about it without spoilers. But it’s definitely more mature and you get more of KristoffYES. I can not recommend this enough. I had sworn off movie theaters last year and made an exception for this because my best friend loved it so much. And it was so worth it. Its kind of dark...and just, great haha.That will never happen because then people won\\'t buy the discs because they can\\'t wait for it to come to Disney+.Unfortunately DVDs and streaming services don’t correspond in terms of release.Until...?Some of the movies have Behind the Scenes/Deleted Scenes on D+.  You have to look on the Extras tab and it\\'ll show some stuff.  I know for sure I watched things under Moana, Inside Out.  Hoping they\\'ll have it for Frozen II also.I like having the digital if I\\'m out somewhere but otherwise I\\'d rather put in a disc at homeInto the Unknown: The Making of Frozen IIMade for the plusFrozen 2thats what I figured, given that it came out a month after frozen 2I don’t think it would be an exaggeration to call TROS the beginning of the end of human society ¯\\\\\\\\\\\\_(ツ)_/¯Descendants 3 isn\\'t here as well.NO.Good to know! I just had enough of Frozen (and I don\\'t have kids) so seeing it in theater was a definite pass. I will gladly watch when it hits streaming though!Like my family! Into the unknownnnnnn🎵🎶All three of my kids are now saying “Samantha?” in Olaf voices, rather than the usual “mommy”I\\'m hoping for commentary! Lion King has a really nice commentary with that guy Happy from the iron man moviesBrave has a bunch, tooWho downvotes this this is funny as hellYeah, I\\'m buying that [stuff] on disc before it hits D+ too....Why?Why?Same here, but still. :)She must know how all Jennys feel after Forrest Gump.I\\'ll buy it, but only because I own all the other star wars movies on blu ray, and it would bother me if I had an incomplete collectionCuzExactly. And I\\'ll seek out the specialest special edition.[deleted]Never heard off this until literally just now lol. I love all the behind the scene stuff like One Day at Disney  and the Imagineer documentary. This sounds like it will be all its productions from movies to rides. Can\\'t wait.For a sec I thought they were making Mulan a disney originalWhich actually isn’t a bad idea tbhMaybe this thread isn\\'t about what you thought it was? Disney Insider isn\\'t postponed, it comes to Disney+ next week.highly unlikely.  It will stay on huluThe entire series is currently on Hulu, so probably notThere are people saying it’s unlikely but i don’t see why not. It’s family-friendly enough for the brand and they are lacking content in family sitcoms. It was a huge show at one stage as well so it would definitely make a good selling point for people interested in the service. Could definitely see it coming to D+ while remaining on hulu.Right now, the TV syndication deals television restrict streaming rights. Hulu only has the most recent season; IIRC, you have to be a USA channel subscriber (through Hulu Live) to more episodes. Once the current syndication deals end (both USA Channel and broadcast), then I think there is a very strong chance it will come to Disney+. One thing to note is that Disney can\\'t just put everything on whatever service they want, they have to guarantee the show\\'s producers and other interests that they get the best deal for it.I was wondering that as well. I would love to see the entire series streaming somewhere (my Hulu only has the most recent season).Hulu only has e 5 most recent episodes not the entire series.Ah okayWell it\\'s probably tied up in licensing issues with other companiesAnyone using their brain should not be surprised by this, but there are also silly people who make it Netflix OR Disney+, which is absurd. The fact of the matter is, Netflix is an infinitely superior choice for casual and hardcore viewing, movies, and originals, because of the sheer quantity, and the varying genres and ratings. There are so many nights that I prefer R (or MA) rated shows and movies, and you just can\\'t get that with Disney+.What I\\'m trying to say is, people shouldn\\'t be seeing the two services as competition (even though strictly speaking they are). The services just scratch very, very different itches, and they compliment my TV watching experiences, never competing for my attention.Netflix has 10 years worth of growing a subscriber base. Disney+ has a few months.One more year until the Office leaves Netflix and they lose half of their subscribers.Disney+ really doesn\\'t have much to offer for all ages unless you want a trip down memory lane. Once the nostalgia high dies down, there\\'s not much else to watch.Disney is shooting themselves in the foot with their asinine family only policyNot surprised Disney+ has been slow as heck lately...These people are still trying to make Netflix and D+ some kind of competitors. How is this still a thing.Probably because Disney+ makes 50% of it\\'s content US only and that\\'s why Europeans are cancelling their orders.Offices is that good? I never seen it.It\\'ll still have more than Disney +Disney+ probably hopes to replenish them with growing library of Marvel and Star Wars originals.But I agree with you. It needs wider varieties of originals for wider range of target audience.If any, I think Apple TV+ has more compelling line up of upcoming original programming.Eh Disney+ will have Simpsons, two seasons of Mandalorian and three Marvel shows by then. The gap will be closer than it is now.Nope Disney + is garbage compared to Netflix no matter what. Netflix will still be superior...Ignoring the Disney+ original shows and movies, just about everything they had posted to Disney+ already existed in digital streaming versions, either on other DisneyNow, FXnow, streaming services, or for sale/rental through Amazon, iTunes, Google Play, etc. So far, they have dumped all those *existing* digital files onto one service, with little effort to curate. They had to really do very little to the back catalog to get where they are now. We can only hope they have an effort underway to digitize and remaster all those other shows over time.They don\\'t put everything there all at once because they know there are people like me who will do a 1 month sub and quit for a while.  By slowly adding stuff, they can encourage more of an ongoing subscription.It’s a massive catalog. And it takes time. They add stuff constantly. Plus bugs and patching issues are also on their agenda.You answered your own question with your first idea. Disney wants to have a good amount of \"new\" content releasing on the service every single week for years to come, but there is no way they have the budgets to do that with brand new releases, so they subsidize that with older shows that are \"new\" to the service.Region locking is even worse, especially since it makes no sense because everything that\\'s locked is 100% owned by Disney.This. This is what has been irritating me is that they\\'ve only been recycling content that people already had access to. I was hoping they would have put a heck of a lot of more time and effort into digitizing and prepping content prior to the launch. I actually had a fantasy that they were going to have all of the Mickey Mouse Club episodes ready to goOK, then can you explain why some shows are US only, like Talespin and Hercules? They already have those shows on the service, why are they region locking them?It doesn\\'t make any sense, which makes me think there\\'s a reason for it. Something so stupid and pathetic that we\\'d all get annoyed by it. Like a single piece if music used in an episode that they can\\'t use in certain countries, or a scene that could be considered offensive in some countries for certain reasons. They wouldn\\'t region block them for no reason, they just won\\'t ever tell us what that reason is.Shows could be licenses in one country but not another.  For example, if Infinity War is licenses to Netflix in the US, they can\\'t show it, but it isn\\'t licensed to anyone in Netherlands, they can show it.  (Don\\'t know if this example is accurate on the Netherlands side, just an example.)Just a user of D+. Wish I knew.They should put all the stuff not on DVD now on DVD so everyone can watch everything, instead of it being like Bonkers, where only Americans and Australians can watch it.Right, but I mean shows that haven\\'t been on TV for over a decade.I genuinely wouldn\\'t be surprised if it was because of the word \"Bonkers\" being considered outdated and offensive over here.:/My thoughts exactly!I\\'ve been tweeting Disney UK, but they\\'ve never got back at me.Press play and then back and back again - that worked for me with an AppleTV at least.Check your TV app store if the Disney+ app is on it. If not, then you might be able to cast the Disney+ content directly onto your tv. If not, then you will need a chromecast or something to be able to cast to.The apps won\\'t be available until launch day.Oh that is interesting. I couldn\\'t find it on mine and thought that it didn\\'t support D+. Hope that changes.The apps aren\\'t on iOS or Android yet either but they\\'re definitely supported.Oh I know the phone and tablet apps aren\\'t. I was talking about my TV.Sure. But apps, in general, don\\'t release before a service is available. There\\'d be no benefit.Put it on Hulu with an X rating, CIA, FBI warning, fingerprint retinal and face scanning, and verbal consent from every human in the house prior to watchingOr just quietly releasing it on Disney Movie Club. Otherwise, this movie will reach public domain eventually.Imo, art shouldn’t be held back. It might not be appropriate in the current time we live, but we can’t close our eyes on what happened. We learn from the mistakes of the past, but if we erase it, how can we learn from it.I don\\'t think anybody really thought that it would ever be added. I would like for it to be but I\\'ve never once thought that it was just something they were waiting on.I always found it amusing that one of their biggest rides at Disney world is based on a film they don\\'t want you to see.I\\'m torn. On the one hand, I hate the idea of sweeping things under the rug pretending they don\\'t exist. But on the other hand, I hear outside of the animated segments, the movie\\'s just not very good so there\\'s that.This is so immature. Disney needs to grow up already, Song Of The South is actually a really good movie.Ridiculous. The thing that’s REALLY “not appropriate in today’s world” is censoring history and preventing future generations from learning about the past.This is so stupid song of the south isn’t even a racist movie. This movie literally was the first time a black person won an Oscar it should be celebrated not hidden.\"The past can hurt. But the way I see it, you can either run from it, or learn from it.\"Guess they\\'re choosing to run...Then why did they allow 1940s Dumbo on?I think they should add it, James Baskett won an honory Oscar for his performance and it’s a shame it’s being buried . His work should be shown and appreciated. Add a disclaimer and special feature discussing the racial elements with respected historiansObviously, it\\'s not like they have a file they can just upload to Disney Plus. The whole thing needs to be remastered and Disney probably does not want to go through the effort for such a controversial film. &#x200B;I wonder if the cartoons from the film will eventually find their way to Disney Plus. They were a bonus feature on Alice in Wonderland, I think.[deleted]I think the question we should really be asking is should a corporation be profiting off of a racist movie in 2020? I think the answer is no. Yes, the movie is art. Yes, we should remember history and learn from the horrors of the past. But this is no place on a streaming service in 2020.Absolutely ridiculous.  There is nothing racist about Song of the South.Welp, there goes my slight considerations of getting Disney+.Isn\\'t this the racist one?Iger is lying! 😡I swear I saw this movie playing on Disney channels vault Disney segment sometime in the early 2000\\'s. Vault Disney ran from 1997 to 2007 on the Disney Channel and once and a while they would play some really racist stuff.Bob Iger is no longer ceo anymore thoWe do have 1080p 35mm scan thanks to random strangers: https://archive.org/details/SongoftheSouth1080pRestorationI\\'m not waiting for the copyright to run out when Disney has moved heaven and earth to make copyright law as long as possible just so they can control everything forever.go learn from it through youtube then. it\\'s not like it\\'s a secret. this isn\\'t censorship, this is censureI disagree. There is a Disney hybrid that needs to be banned for racism, and it isn\\'t *Song of the South, So Dear to My Heart, Bedknobs and Broomsticks* (which they should be arrested for cutting Roddy McDowall out of again)*, Pete\\'s Dragon* (also a Card Walker [cut job](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7e480d2cGE))*, Tron, Who Framed Roger Rabbit* or *Enchanted*:&#x200B;[https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/28/movies/mary-poppins-returns-blackface.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/28/movies/mary-poppins-returns-blackface.html)&#x200B;I would rather watch *Song of the South* that be subjected to one thoroughly maudlin millisecond of that mess. Heck, I\\'d rather watch ANYTHING from the Ron Miller years, and I do mean anything.There are a bunch of movies that are never going to be added to Disney+, like a lot of war propaganda shorts (Der Fuehrer\\'s Face for example), which is a shame because there is a lot of interesting, hard to find stuff in there. It would be nice if they would put those controversial movies behind a parental lock or something, but yeah, that\\'s never going to happen.One of their signature songs (Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah) comes from the movie as well.It\\'s kinda boring outside the animated segments, but not overly racist. It\\'s just very insensitive. The movie is about this fictional black character (Uncle Remus) telling folk tales that black slaves used to tell each other to two white kids to entertain them. The movie never mentions slavery although it\\'s set on a plantation. The problem is that there is no real \\'clean\\' way to tell these stories. The original author (Joel Chandler Harris) was already very controversial for taking original African-American folk tales and making them his own. On the other hand most people would never even know about these stories without this movie. And in a way it\\'s a very progressive movie. It\\'s one of the first if not the first movie focused on black culture with a black lead actor (James Baskett), So there\\'s that.Yeah, real talk, if anyone has a drive to watch the film, it\\'s pretty easy to find if you know where to look.And yeah, it\\'s really boring...and long. Really the animated segments are the best part.But really this revisionist thing has been Disney\\'s MO for ages. Acknowledging their history runs counter to their current \"family friendly\" brand marketing.I consider it Walt Disney\\'s true crowning achievement and will not buy ANY Disney products until it is back for good. This \"don\\'t like it, don\\'t watch it\" crap is just that: crap. The film\\'s critics feel they have the right to make that decision for others, so that makes them fascists in intent and effect. Fascism with a smiley face is still fascism.Hattie McDaniel was the first African American actor/actress to win an Oscar, Best Supporting Actress in 1939 For Gone with the Wind. Not to belittle James Baskett’s Oscar, but it was honorary, he was not in contention in a category.Well  that movie\\'s cultural insensitivity lasts for a few minutes of screen time, Song of the South\\'s is pretty much the entire run time. Can\\'t very well fast-forward through an entire movie, can ya?The voice of Br\\'er Rabbit was a black man. Try again. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny\\\\_Lee\\\\_(actor)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Lee_(actor))It’s more subtle but it’s not trying to be racist... yeah, this is what I heard, haven’t watched the film myself yet.They used to use some of the animated segments from it in Wonderful World of Disney anthology episodes on TV and disney Vault would run some of those. But the last time the whole movie we exhibited in the U.S. by Disney was an arthouse theater run in the \\'86-\\'87)And it looks better than the Blu-rays of *Sword in the Stone, Robin Hood, Rescuers, Jungle Book, Aristocats, Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh,* and anything from that era. If Disney did it themselves, they would scrub out the film grain along with dirt, scratches, and cel dust. The combination of live-action and animation holds up better in HD than I thought it would, and if subsequent technologies were better at combining animation with live footage, the animation itself was not.Actually if it’s that big of a deal, revoke their own copyright on it, release the damn thing freely as a public service, and strike up a conversation globally of how we can do better, and what media like this can teach us societally.What are you talking about with bedknobs and broomsticks?For me the biggest thing is - What Disney did well was production quality / value. I love watching for the sets and scenary. S things might not be appropriate, but Disnye put so much into them they are fun to watch just because of that. A great example is Pete\\'s Dragon. There\\'s a whole song about how the family \"owns\" Pete and they have a \"bill of sale\". And other things in it, but the set and production quality was insane. Like the whole bar scene where Nora is dancing and singing and they have the barrels they walk on and all that. Or the forest sets.They’ll be more likely to be added when Iger leaves.Yeah, it\\'s a real headscratcher, innit?But they were in the movie together.Is that a challenge?It\\'s not even racist what are you talking about?If it wasn’t for the Mickey Mouse copyright act of 1998, the film’s copyright would be expiring next year, and all of Walt’s first five features, all the Silly Symphonies, and all the pre-Technicolor shorts would be PD by now. When Walt was alive, they only seemed interested in protecting what was legally theirs under existing law, not in lobbying to make those laws absurdly long.They went back to the short 117 minute version only on Blu-ray and every place that had it prior to August 12, 2014. iTunes and VUDU had the 139 minute restored cut in HD until that point. Disney+ is no different, even though they seem to have found a better version of that cut song from *The Muppet Christmas Carol.*And there’s an even shorter version of that out there made for the 1979 reissue! Even the Sherman brothers couldn’t bring themselves to watch that version. That was what they put out on video in Europe and Australia in the 1980s. Never have I seen a trio of films treated so appallingly by the studio that made them.Great, thanks.  Now I have Shelley Winters in my head singing \"We got the bill of sale right here\".  And it will stick with me all day now, lol.Iger should be leaving in chains. I hope the SEC investigation leads to criminal prosecution.I was a huge Disney fan. The keyword is \"was.\"Disney\\'s copyright concerns actually go back much, much farther than 1998.  Universal screwed Walt out of the characters he created when he worked for them before starting his own studio, like Oswald.  When he started his own studio and created new characters, he wanted to be sure that he could never lose them again.  So really, you can blame Universal for Disney\\'s overbearing stance on their IPs.That movie was my childhood. Could you send me a link to detail of what to keep and eye out for? Also more info on muppets...?Lol OH PEEETIE!!Yes.  Disney was at it\\'s best when Walt was alive and running it.And they were both partners in the Betamax lawsuit against Sony in the 1970s.https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0066817/alternateversionshttps://m.imdb.com/title/tt0104940/alternateversionsYeah, but Walt was dead by then.Thanks!It was certainly in character for the company.You’re welcome. Everywhere I go, I seem to be hearing a lot of complaints about Disney and this service for one reason or another. Not enough catalog titles, not enough new content, censorship.And not only did Robert Iger double down on *Song of the South’s* continued suppression, he hinted very strongly that more titles would be subjected to this kind of treatment in the future. He is the worst CEO this company has ever had. A white man acting in defiance of a black woman to suppress the work of black actors. He’s the racist one.Oh, and the choreographer of *Bedknobs and Broomsticks*, Donald McKayle, was also African-American, and it was largely his work that suffered from the cuts made to it. https://www.cartoonbrew.com/disney/first-act-disney-legend-whoopi-goldberg-tells-disney-stop-hiding-history-152327.htmlMy biggest problems with the platform are it’s bugginess and that I can’t really manage favorites/watch list like I’d like toThis 100% will not happen because of one thing: money. There is no way they\\'re going to recoup a $250M budget + marketing cost by releasing a movie on Disney+ and foregoing the theatre. If anything, you\\'re going to see delays, ala Fast 9 and 007.Here in the UK we can’t wait til it launches on March 24th, wouldn’t mind them releasing it early though as it looks like a fair few people will be self isolating.I smell an early drop of Frozen 2  if this keeps up.I agree it would be nice, but not happening. As others stated, money is one big factor. But an even bigger factor is that the infrastructure couldn\\'t handle it. Remember when D+ first went live, all the problems they had? Many of those problems was due to more people jumping on than they expected, and overloading the servers they had in place. Now that the traffic has settled down, and improvements made to handle the load as other regions come online, could you imagine what would happen if they dumped a major motion picture on service instead of releasing it in the theater? The problems would be tenfold at least. And they could beef up the infrastructure to handle a big load like that, but by the time they got it done, tested, and online, coronapocalypse will be over, and people will be going to the theater to see it on the big screen.Completely agree. Maybe it onboards new users but even then, it’d pale in comparison in profit. They also only benefit once with initial signup, whereas every trip to the theater is revenue. Just interesting to think about because they have a perfect distribution platform in a time where public health officials are calling for social distancingThey do *not* have a perfect distribution platforms for brand new, intended for theatrical release movies. For the reasons stated above: the money does not add up.If they decided to go this route, it would likely be more in-line with buying digital movies: rent Black Widow for $X.Yea, ‘perfect’ might not have been the best word. The average movie ticket costs more than the price for Disney+. And a theatrical release of that level will probably be watched by multiple people so they’d be losing money there as well. And like I said before, if you were to watch the movie multiple times in a single month period before your service payment is due, there’s another place they can lose moneyUltimately, just a fun thought experiment as many businesses are faced with the question of how they’ll adjust to the conditions COVID-19 has causedIt would be a loss for them to do that. They can just push the release back if they see that premier nights/weekend box office won\\'t give high numbers (money) due to the virus.They have?  Noelle, the Lady an the Tramp remake, Timmy Failure, and Togo are straight to Disney Plus movies. They will release Stargirl tomorrow.When you take your family of four to the theater that\\'s a lot of money you\\'re leaving on the table for just an extra fee for home viewing.Even if it\\'s just you and a date, that\\'s $14-$25 they\\'re not getting (I suppose it depends on the \"additional fee\" you\\'re thinking about).I am sure OP is talking about the movies that have a theatrical release be released on Disney+ instead. For example, instead of the new Mulan moviy being sent theaters, it goes straight to Disney+Well of course Disney are going to have originals only exclusive to the service, I mean they have to make Disney+ vibrant. For the most part, all the movies Disney makes will go to the theaters but occasionally they’ll just put one straight to Disney+. From the pattern we’ve seen, Disney has only out the not so popular films on the service that obviously wouldn’t of performed well in theaters. This can change however since the Lilo And Stitch live action remake could be very popular and that’s going straight to Disney+.Yes that is what i am referring to. i should have worded it better. Thank youThey\\'ll simply lose to much money.  They have it down to a science how much time to keep it in theaters, then in blu ray sales, then in premium channels/streaming services.  Like the other person said, they\\'d have to charge $50-60 a person to make up the difference. It\\'s simple not worth the risk of someone uploading it to a file sharing site and having people download it for free.  Other movies that aren\\'t going to be popular get the straight to Disney Plus treatment.The movies you mentioned were never released in theaters, they were straight to streaming. OP is talking about taking the movies that were planned for theaters and moving them directly to streaming instead.Big Bang Theory and live sports... suddenly I want a Disney+/Hulu combined appIt was cancelled because of the corona virus I thinkThere will be a web conference call on the day Disney+ launches for the UK and Europe. It’ll basically be a press conference but live like on YouTube for instance. On here, we can definitely get more news such as the Marvel and Star Wars originals.Thought was meant to be this weekMarvel, Star Wars, Other MarvelOld Man LokiIt’s almost as if they’re focusing on their most popular franchises...I’m sure Marvel will work around this. They have an excellent green screen studio.Why does this seem like the 10th time something got halted due to the coronavirus? Why not just shoot things on a soundstage at this pointI thought they finished filmingIt\\'s a good thing that Disney doesn\\'t have any other business interests that have a lot of people (from AROUND THE WORLD) gathering in large groups at once.[deleted]BOOOI just hope it don\\'t end up like Superman\\'s face in Justice league if you know what I meanThey don’t do anything in house. It’s all farmed out to multiple companies otherwise the length of making a movie will be insanely long. And while you can replace with cgi it’ll insanely increase the budget.Because it\\'s not just about shooting overseas, but also the amount of people gathering at the same place..a number of crew coming from different countriesBecause peoples safety is more important than a tv show.It depends what they are shooting.  Most of it is but you can\\'t replicate all the architecture and environment on a sound stage easily.As of now, I don\\'t think the show is getting delayed. The article makes it seem like they are going to figure out how shoot the scenes on a sound stage or something similar.Everything is being delayed because of coarnavirus[The struggle is real...](https://i.chzbgr.com/full/9384879104/hDCA8F1D1/man)I’m sure Disney can afford it, especially if they don’t want to get too behind schedule.It\\'s a good thing that Disney doesn\\'t have any other business interests that have a lot of people (from AROUND THE WORLD)  gathering in large groups at once.Huhhh???? /s to be clear, though, I want my show!!!!!What sayGuys, you know green screen was like half of Endgame right? They’re GOOD with itThe point is to make money. It’s not like postponing will delay an avengers movie.He was complaining about Disney plus everything being delayed not  even mentioning coronavirusThe suit cgi was horrible.The bell in FFH was also pretty badTeamo Supremeo and The Weekenders as well.you forgot to mention american dragon jake longProbably because they haven\\'t been digitized and released anywhere yet.I would love to see the non-Simpsons non-adult Fox cartoon series (such as the Filmation adaptions of Journey to the Center of the Earth and Fantastic Voyage, 1975\\'s Return to the Planet of the Apes, the 1970 DePatie-Freleng adaption of Doctor Dolittle, 1969\\'s The Hardy Boys, and Capitol Critters) as well.Probably a licensing issue. While they own the IP\\'S there probably  paperwork involve to make sure producers get their cut if revenue is involved for distributing the shows. If not idk.I have no clue.I\\'d also like to see Eek the Cat.I just wish they\\'d treat people outside of the US better.Wait. You got Gummi Bears. All seasons I presume?They could still be under contract with someone else rights wise? And when they aren’t Disney will put them up.Sauce?I don\\'t know, maybe? I really wanted Bonkers though.That can’t be the sole reason. The same situation applies to the Netherlands (we are missing even more content than the UK). An example: five episodes of the original Mickey Mouse Club (1955) have been available on Disney+ in the US since launch. They were not made available in the Netherlands and are not listed among the expected UK content. There is NO WAY this show is under contract anywhere else. Then why is it not available?Shows like Bonkers, Doug, TaleSpin etc. haven’t been broadcast in the Netherlands for years. I would be highly surprised if they are under contract somewhere. Why are they not available?Finally, the classic animated shorts. In the Netherlands only TEN of these were made available. Other countries have dozens more. Why is that?The frustrating thing is that it seems impossible to get an explanation out of Disney (I have been trying for almost four months now). I have no problem at all with waiting another year for this content, as long as I know it’s coming eventually. But Disney does not answer any queries about this. So at the moment Disney+ seems like something that is primarily aimed at Americans and Canadians. European users are just good for paying and being satisfied with severely limited content.[https://uk.ign.com/articles/disney-plus-announces-full-content-line-up-for-the-uk](https://uk.ign.com/articles/disney-plus-announces-full-content-line-up-for-the-uk)Heinz Tomato ketchup is the preferred Sauce. You were looking for SourceOh wait. I looked for the Gummi Bears and they are. All six seasons. That wasn’t the case when I got D+ in November. Thank you for the reminder. I also looked for Bonkers. No such luck.It\\'s not always just the show itself being under licence, sometimes it\\'s content like music they can\\'t use in certain countries etc. Although that seems unlikely in this case.Of course it’s probably not a sole reason. I just know it’s a very common reason with new platforms launching from the actual originators of the content. Im not sure if Disney is withholding stuff for other reasons. I mean this is the company known for its vault or if there are technical issues or something else. I just know that could be one of the reasons. Working in the field it’s something that comes up a lot with people I talk to.It hasn’t even started airing in Aus. They won’t have it till the season finishes.I can’t wait my son loves that show and will dance when the opening credits are onLooks like the first episodes of season 2 start in Australia on Tuesday 👍That\\'s a big list.Mine is just the classic muppet showI think that a lot of this PG-13 stuff should be on Disney+, but it really seems as though they\\'re set on sticking to PG and under (with only a few notable exceptions, like the Marvel films and The Simpsons). Most of this would make sense on D+, as it would draw in an older demo without being too explicit for younger viewers -- shows like Modern Family and Fresh Off the Boat are great family viewing, and don\\'t feature anything more objectionable than The Simpsons does. I still think most of it will end up on Hulu, unfortunately...which as a Canadian, means I won\\'t be able to access it.American Dragon: Jake LongEnchantedPepper AnnThe Original Brave Little Toaster.Is that the content you want to see, or did you just try to find everything that Disney doesnt have on there?I want them to focus more on vault stuff. SO many movies and tv shows from the 40\\'s - 70\\'s that need to be added. Stuff i used to watch on the Disney channel as a kid when cable was first a thing.  Also....

It\\'s not on any other streaming service and I would watch it (Because I never have) if it was.Most of the TV shows you listed are all on HuluOh man - - I forgot about Titan A.E. , yes please bring that to Disney+.

I\\'ve heard the reason why it\\'s not available is because it\\'s still on Netflix, though.The Jersey pleaseI would love to see Malchom in the MiddleI don\\'t think Digimon\\'s happening; the movie hasn\\'t even gotten a home video release of any kind since the initial release; no blu-rays, no streaming options. Plus it was never really owned by Fox; Saban held the license back in the day, but the franchise has changed hands since then.Besides, I think I\\'d prefer a complete, uncut redub of the three flicks put together. The third part was especially butchered, and since we\\'re getting full releases of the newer movies, it\\'d make sense to do something about the older ones.* 1997 Rogers and Hamerstein\\'s Cinderella telefilm* 2003 The Music Man telefilm* Basically every Wonderful World of Disney filmThe original Bug Juice seriesSong of the SouthAnd also Howard the DuckThe original Muppet show. They’ve only ever even released the first three seasons on dvd and announced season four would be released but it’s been a few years and nothing.....Tower of TerrorThey need to do something because I watched the mandolorian and some movies when it come out end haven’t touched it since. They need to add some stuffRemember folks to keep requesting on the Disney+ help page if you want to see more movies added also some of this content seems to be too \"mature\" for Disney+ so we might see some of these films on Hulu instead.The Song of the South.   Maybe they can produce a documentary to explain the racist times it portrays.  But it\\'s got some really great songs like Zipity-doo-dah, and br\\'er rabbit  tales.&#x200B;Oh, and the Star Wars Christmas special.Bear in the Big Blue House for sure! I’ve been making it the first thing I request for the service every time I use the request feature every 2-3 days! It’s been my DREAM to see it again after all these years and I’ve been wishing to see it again to complete my childhood! My Dad would love to see it as well, as he was a big fan, too!90% of this doesn’t qualify for Disney plus based on rating and if anything is already or will end up on Hulu.In a perfect world, everythingI\\'d like to see the original early Disney Channel shows like *Dumbo\\'s Circus,* and maybe the television specials they would make whenever a new park opened.

Loved that movie as a kid.I just want house of mouse and adventures of buzz Lightyear. I can’t ever see Disney ever adding JoJo Rabbit thought.More classic cartoons from the 30’s and 40’s.Not sure what to call them, but I had a library of Winnie the Pooh shorts on VHS when I was a kid. My daughter absolutely loves Winnie the Pooh, so it would be cool to have even more content to cycle through with her!Walt Disney’s weekly TV show!!! I’m devastated that it isn’t on there yet. Also Modern Family.King of the HillMore classic Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse cartoons.But really Just want to watch DuckTales, Darwing Duck et cetera in the proper order. Seriously, Darkwing Duck episode ONE is listed as ep 29 the order is all off.I honestly agree with a lot of thesePercy Jackson reboot Not that you’re keeping track or anything.Mighty MedLife with Derek, but I know it won’t happen because Disney doesn’t own it :( and Cory in the House.Fish hooks is my main one for nowI have a feeling that the Independence Day films might be added in July around the fourth or on the fourth. Maybe lol.Does anyone know why Kick Buttoski isn’t on Disney+I would like see Britannic on Disney+. it was a Fox Family (now Freeform) tv movie which was a WW1 spy movie based on the sinking of the sinking HMHS Britannic )Titanic\\'s sister ship).

It probably isn\\'t on Disney+ because they have to make a deal with Nintendo because the characters are trademarked by Nintendo back in 1981.I’d love them to add house of mouseFuturamaRunaway BrainIf Nickelodeon will allow it I’d like to see drake and josh on there since Hulu doesn’t even have all the episodes.[*Walt Disney\\'s Wonderful World of Color.* [*EDIT: According to Wikipedia the show has gone by many names.]](https://i.imgur.com/cqANELr.jpg) If it\\'s the one that I\\'m thinking of. Is that they show where Walt himself was the host and he showed the process of animation? He showed off the rotoscope that they used for Bambi and how they built some of animatronics that they used in the parks?I would looooove to watch that!Some of what you listed is already available on Hulu (in the US, at least). It’s a long list and I don’t have time to go through it all, sorry.Sing Along Songs!!!I want Pair of Kings and A.N.T. FarmNo way in hell Disney owns everything on that list? So it would be very difficultThe OG Muppet Show, and Muppet Classic Theater was a good movie, I\\'d like to see them add that. Also House of Mouse, and the House of Villains special they did. I know we are here talking about Disney+ ,but as a side note, it\\'d be really cool if somebody somewhere started streaming Nickelodeon throwbacks-Angry Beavers, Are You Afraid of the Dark, Legends of the Hidden Temple, Blue\\'s Clues (before Steve left and it got weird), Little Bear, Maggie and the Ferocious Beast, Rocko\\'s Modern Life, Ahhh! Real Monsters, Cat Dog, etc.Nice list but rule 4 is don’t repost ([From this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/ejfptj/what_titles_would_you_like_to_see/)) (he commented yesterday on it and the reposts it for karma and somehow gets more)* Hidalgo* Ever After* Enchanted* Ewok movies* Star Wars Christmas Special (seriously)* Titan AE* Flight of the Navigator* Ford Vs Ferrari* The Hitchiker\\'s Guide to the GalaxyI see your list (and agree with it) and add:Television Shows:*Toad Patrol**Filmore**What-a-Mess**Honey, I Shrunk the Kids The Series**Wish Kid**Rupert**Dark Angel* (both live action and animated as the two are not related and were owned by Fox, which Disney now owns)*Dave the Barbarian*Movies:*Die Hard* (All of them)*Home Alone* (the first two)*Fantastic Four* (Actually, instead of showing the old ones, I\\'d like the writers at Disney--you know, the ones that made the *Avengers* such a hit, to make us a new one. That we can then watch on Disney+.)*Aliens* (Just the first and second, please. The rest suck rotten eggs, in my opinion.)*X-Files* (C\\'mon, Disney; you *own* them now! Flaunt it!)And this is just an added side note, but I\\'d be deeply appreciative if Disney could gather its shorts under single collections. Like, the *Donald Duck* collection, or the *Mickey Mouse* collection (not to be confused with *Steamboat Willie*, because while Willie influenced Mickey I do not believe they are the same character), or so on.Also, until I got Disney+, I had no idea that *Pollyanna* was a movie and not just a book.They can\\'t because that\\'s on Hulu and Disney + knows they already have enough to reel you in so there keeping that on Hulu but if they did get all this stuff there is no doubt in my mind they would be the best streaming serviceRight now I would like just the new thing...not an old show, but for Disney to produce a new show/series of Sky High. I would love to see a 4 season run following a group of kids through all 4 years of Sky High.A LOT of those are definitely Hulu only material.Buzz Lightyear of Star Command also [Copied from this post and he commented so we know he saw it because he commented (click on text)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/ejfptj/what_titles_would_you_like_to_see/fk21qy3/?context=3)Literally all of the cartoon series, out GLOBALLY instead of US only.The movie Anastasia (1997)Eek the Cat. Monster Farm. Lloyd in Space. Dave the Barbarian. Yin Yang Yo. Pickle and Peanut. The Weekenders. Teamo Supremo. Brandy and Mr Whiskers.FROZEN 2Most of these are on Hulu. Remember that Disney owns Hulu? All the PG-13 movies and series are located in Hulu.UNDER WRAPS!!!also Moulin Rouge!Slugterra.Disney proper: Pepper Ann, Dinosaurs, The Golden Girls, More Classic Disney Shorts, Wonderful World of Color episodes, The Love Bug 1981 TV series, The Wuzzles, Make Mine Music.20th Century Studios: Malcolm in the Middle, Journey to the Center of the Earth and Fantastic Voyage Fox/Filmation cartoons, The Tracey Ullman Show, Capitol Critters, 1969\\'s The Hardy Boys cartoon, Fantastic Four films, X-Men Films.One of the main reasons I unsubscribed from Disney Plus was because of how much was lacking when they talked up how it would have basically everything they’ve owned. Not to mention all the 20th Century Fox stuff that they own and aren’t doing anything with...I’d add It’s Always Sunny to that listThe Jim Henson Hour (1989) is great also* Fraggle Rock* The Story TellerI want all of the Jim Henson content. It breaks my heart that the Muppets don’t really get the love they deserve.i just want muppets in space is that too much to askThe Muppet Show I would die for them to get.  Also would love this;   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt\\\\_Disney\\\\_anthology\\\\_television\\\\_series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_anthology_television_series)THISMe too! And all the original Muppet Babies. My toddlers love the classic episodes but we are forced to watch the on YouTube. Oddly enough they wont watch the new ones for more than a minute or two.I’m fairly certain they kept the entire scene in ‘10 Things I Hate About You’ when the bully draws a dick on the other kids face. Not to mention the weed scene and all of the alcohol. So I understand where you’re coming from but I’m hopeful that they keep adding adult-ish media.Contrary to popular perception, most episodes of The Simpsons are actually TV-PG.They should have a section for more adult content but I get the want for it to go to Hulu. They should just merge together.Yeah, a lot/most of that would more likely end up on Hulu (if it’s not already there).Modern Family is very objectionable for religious conservative families of all faiths.With just the title you\\'ve managed to get the theme song stuck in my headYes! Why isn\\'t it on there yet?This! I was so disappointed it wasnt on thereThis is the thing that irks me the most. They have the bad ones but not the good ones on there.Both actually. It’s stuff I want to see added on their service. A lot of the films I listed I haven’t seen. But my thought process was that all these films and series can help add variety to their service in terms of content. I like having all Disney content that is family friendly enough by Disney’s standards to be on Disney Plus all in one place.Agreed. I’m just starting my own family and I’m more interested in sharing cartoons from my youth (early 90s and all the old stuff that was hoarded on vhs by family members) all the Disney channel stuff should wait another 10-15 years when that demographic starts having kids in larger numbers or else it’s just going to take up space and not be watched. Let us get our kicks first!!I 2nd this.Great list.  I am puzzled why many of these are not already showing since you can readily rent or buy them on Amazon prime streaming.  Example:  Follow Me, Boys!Popeye’s rights are owned by Paramount in the US so it won’t be on Disney plus soon. Maybe in other territories though.Late to this, but most of these were streaming on Hoopla for years, which was great if you had a library account connected to it. I want to say maybe a month or 2 before Disney+ started, they all disappeared from Hoopla. I thought that meant they’d be on Disney+, but so far, nope.They should just go by decades and make sure they have a complete library on there or give resources to rent copies by mail (oldschool Netflix) for things they don’t feel would get a lot of plays but still need to be included for historical value. I’m all about historical Disney. I’m one of the few that think certain films, despite controversy or being outdated for any reason, should be available for viewing, even if it’s only for a mail order rent, I mean a simple disclaimer is fine.Completely agree.No Hulu in CanadaHeyo!!!!If they\\'d just dump nearly all if not all of the old Donald Duck and Mickey, Chip n Dale, et cetera id feel like the money was well spent on the service.Real, and it had a great theme songOmg one of my faves! Sorely missedSuch a good show!  I was reminded of the show recently.  I\\'ve been binge-watching Smallville, lately, and Lee Thompson Young\\'s appearances jarred my memory just a few weeks ago!  Sad he\\'s gone, though.Same 😭There are two types of people: those who love Count of Monte Cristo and those who haven’t seen it yetMy love for Henry Cavill began with that movie. I\\'m so glad the rest of the world now understands too.Amazing movie, really loved itI saw that the other day for the first time.It should be in the sidebar of /r/ProRevengeYou really should find a way to get your hands on it. It’s an underrated gem.Well then they need to make it available in CanadaYea I know. For me personally I prefer all content that is family friendly enough by Disney’s standards to be all on Disney Plus all in one place.already in the works.Yes!! I would live this!Just Exile with Corey Feldman would be fantastic. We taped it\\'s original airing watched it dozens of times as kids. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exile_(1990_film)Yessss!I love the idea of a random button for Disney movies.  Unless I\\'ve seen it recently, most Disney movies are very re-watchable.Black-ish is on ABC and produced by ABC Studios. Everything I listed is owned by Disney.Yh a lot of the stuff on that list is from Hulu, Fox, ABC, etc.They also haven\\'t uploaded the old Fox Family channel (it was restructuring into ABC Family which is now Freeform) original tv movies like Britannic on any streaming platformIn the U.S. Disney Plus, the first Ice Age is on there.I mean the restThe exceptions are based on Disney not wanting R rated content on their service. So I was listing films I personally want to see added on the service but also being mindful of Disney’s strict no R Rated stuff on their service.I’m pretty sure they still have the rights to the movie at least. Toei Animation owns the rights to Digimon now, but since this movie was so... uniquely put together, it’s its own thing now and is more of a standalone Americanized film than one associated with Digimon. I think Disney owns it outright but they don’t know what to do with it. It might end up on Hulu or something.All of the films I listed are PG-13. Same for the tv series, they are either TV-14 or lower.The Lost Empire?[deleted]Those have more of a Hulu feel to meYeah but I think it should move to Disney+\"Not adding The Simpsons to the catalogue wouldn’t have been wise, but leaving Futurama (another Fox property) out isn’t a tragedy, and the studio can justify it with either it not being “family-friendly” (as is the case with Family Guy and American Dad) or not drawing as many viewers as The Simpson does.\"Besides, do you really want to have to explain what \"Death By Snu-Snu\" means?Are you referring to how it’s not Family friendly enough by Disney’s standards or that it wasn’t made by Disney? Because Futurama was made by 20th Century Television which Disney owns.Yea, there was a second one.Yes it is true I did respond to your post. But to be honest I wanted to post a personal list of content I wanted to see added on Disney Plus but the post was deleted because it wasn’t a question. So I made a different post with a question on it. I didn’t do it for karma because to be honest I don’t know what that is, I just wanted to share my list. I apologize for an inconvenience.I asked this question because I wanted to share my list of content that Disney owns to be added on Disney Plus. I also wanted to see people’s own suggestions and their response to my list. I am sorry for unintentionally breaking a rule.Fraggle Rock isn\\'t a Disney production. It\\'s entirely owned and distributed through the Jim Henson Company.Storyteller not owned by Disney either. But the Jim Henson Studios has been developing a new Storyteller series.> I want all of the Jim Henson contentWatch this:https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLplWWKocAfTYIGzH8eQ0x0kEQgoV9CpYmOr Muppet Family Christmas.

Couldn’t hurt!  I did the first day I got D+ and didn’t find it there.As was I. I love that show.I don\\'t even really wanna watch it, but it still bothers me so much that they don\\'t have the original one.Anastasia is already on there. At least in Canada.That actually could be why - they might have some sort of distribution agreement in place with Amazon for some of their titles.a lot of those *already* are on Hulu,We\\'ll be getting Hulu in 2021, hopefully.Licensing agreements make this almost impossible until the agreement expire. Check Family ChannelAnd it really effin sucks. Like why?!?!??!Right?! I was talking about Scrubs recently and reminded that he was the only bright spot for interns in those last seasons. Sad news about himProblem with that is that a lot of Hulu shows are already on different streaming platforms in Canada and other countries.And Australia (Though we already have a few of the movies listed)And the UKMost of the things you listed are on Hulu specifically because they aren’t family friendly enough by Disney’s standardsNo, I meant the old one from the 90s.fortunately for you that movie is atleast free on youtubeOk cool I just was wondering because I haven’t seen some of theseAnd while it is amazing on Netflix currently, we need Glee!!!yes Britannic is probably the best TV movie I have watchedAustralia has them all.I see.PG-13 or not, do you really think Bohemian Rhapsody is appropriate for kids?You really think Disney is going to put TV-14 content on D+??? And I’m pretty sure the only PG-13 movies on D+ are the Marvel movies, they aren’t going to put more PG-13 content on D+ unless they have a good reason to (more Marvel). I don’t think you understand the target audience of D+. There is a reason D bought a majority share of Hulu.Yes! It is on Disney+ here in Canada but only in French.IKR but thankfully I’m pretty sure we’re getting a reboot soon if Disney doesn’t then there stupid I mean there’s already so many people who loves the books imagine what a good tv series would doohh true, true...yeah I agree...and hahaha yeah that would be hard to explain lol (death by snu-snu) hahaI guess I was referring to how its not family friendly by Disney’s standards...and ohh wow, didnt know that...(good to know) though =)Ok I understandI thought Disney owned the Jim Henson Company.I love Defunctland! Whenever that series was announced, I was so happy! Kevin didn’t disappoint with that series.I honestly wish Disney would step their game up a little bit and have more in their Vaults section.  They have the chance to really re-test a lot of old content that is literally just sitting there gathering dust... even if it\\'s not \"the most popular\" it still merits a look by the nitpicky viewer.That was always my dream growing up that at some point in the future the Internet would just have everything... every movie, every VHS that never made it to DVD etc. but it\\'s just like one big Blockbuster store nowadays. :(He\\'s cool, he\\'s hot like a frozen sun He\\'s young and fast, he\\'s the chosen one People, we\\'re not braggin\\' He\\'s the American Dragon He\\'s gonna stop his enemies with his dragon power Dragon teeth, dragon tail, Burnin\\' dragon fire A real live wire American Dragon!! \"Dragon Up!\" American Dragon!! \"Oh, oh, oh, woah!\" He\\'s the American Dragon free style with the dragon His skills are getting faster with Grandpa the master His destiny will walk up streets Show time, baby, for the legacy!!

I really hope so.I\\'m pretty sure Hulu is available in the UK on NOWtv, unless I\\'m just imagining it.Also, because it makes more sense to have you pay for both D+ and Hulu rather than just 1But at the same time The Simpsons is both on Hulu and Disney Plus (First 30 Seasons) and Runaways. Both shows feature some mature themes and language but is suitable enough for people of all ages.Poor quality, but you\\'re right.That\\'s nice :)All the X-Men movies are PG-13 (except for the Deadpool movies, which are rated R.)After watching the Captain America films and \\'\\'10 things I hate about You\\'\\'&#x200B;YesI mean 10 things i hate about you is on there. It\\'s really just splitting hairs at this pointThey added the \"10 things I hate about you\" movie, no idea why. Other then it is good.There are a couple of episodes of The Simpsons that are TV-14 like the Treehouse of Horror episodes and the Runaways tv series and some episodes of The Mandalorian are TV-14. TV-14 is allowed. They said shows that are TV-14 are allowed on Disney Plus but I believe series that are TV-14 but still suitable enough for everyone are allowed.No, they only acquired the Muppets, any other characters or IPs stayed with HensonI know right, plus some shows are US only onD+ and they\\'re not even on DVD, so the good-ol\\' \"US exclusives club\" strikes again. A club Netflix tried so hard to take down.If you’re on mobile, click on your profile icon, then select help. From there select ‘give feedback’ and in the what would you like to do? Drop down menu select ‘request a film or show’I am a 44 yr old gramma and I just really miss this show. Lol.You may be thinking of hayu. Which I think is owned by the Kardashians.Hulu is definitely not available in the UK.I cant even find half the movies I want to watch.  Id gladly take poor quality at this pointLogan is R and one Deadpool movie was redone as PG-13.I agree great movie but odd choice for D+Reee\\'s in DisneyWell, that was a bit of a difference...I know. I just somehow forgot about that movie. Maybe because it doesn’t feel like an X-Men movie.Interesting that in India they have no problems mixing the Disney+ brand with mature content from FX, HBO, Showtime...It\\'s only disney originals and movies with all the disadvantages of hotstar. There are so many shows like chip n dale, spiderman, talespin, gargoyles are not there at all. No HDR.Update just got reversed. Content is there but branding has been removed. Also, Disney really needs to improve Hotstar. The experience of watching anything in Hotstar is so bad that I end up downloading instead.Hotstar also has been accused of upscaling 480p or 540p to make it look like 1080p. No HDR or 4k support. No account Settings. Shitty Video player. Buffering in this age. Cropping of videos. Speeding up videos. Reducing the bitrate. These are just some of the common complaints against Hotstar. And last but not the least, too much censoring.The power of Hotstar. Disney bending their rules to put Hotstar branding to win India (high priority market outside of the US).The Simpsons not available :(Sounds like the update is reversed.It was a beta update. They were testing the waters. They\\'re not responding to any tweets or questions from people about it, but apparently we\\'ll learn more on Friday (whether that\\'s tomorrow or day after is unclear), according to TechCrunch, who\\'ve apparently talked to a spokesperson from Hotstar. The no HDR isn\\'t a deal breaker, but if there isn\\'t the entire Disney+ library at launch, I see no reason to shell out money for the yearly plan. It\\'s like asking for extra money for just a couple of extra shows/movies, that too subject to their bizarre censorship standards.Would be nice of them to bring multiple profiles and HDR, but I think that is too much to ask for at this point.I think they will do it in uk too as we have no hulu or thatThe only reason I use hotstar is because of HBO shows, PL,  F1 and IPL (sadly all of them in only 30fps). Their bitrate is the worst and 1080p looks at best 720 because of this. And not to mention the annoying water mark over the videos. Disney seriously needs to look into improving the streaming quality of hotstar.Might not even come out in India if Hotstar has their way. Especially after the whole Apu controversy.I’d love that but I really doubt it.Only the USA has Hulu. Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and the Netherlands don’t and Disney aren’t adding the things relegated to Hulu in the USA on to D+ here.No Hulu here in Canada either but we have Disney+ since launchIn their defense, The Mandalorian looks really good on Hotstar. Doesn\\'t seem like 720p, but may very well be. Whether this is due to the show\\'s masters being better than most content in India already is unclear, but it looks relatively pristine on the app. Also, it would be nice to get official confirmation from them on whether HDR is being used for certain content, because I could have sworn that while I was checking the quality of episodes of The Mandalorian on the app last night, the dynamic range seemed better than most content.&#x200B;EDIT: Seems like they\\'re implementing fairplay DRM on their content now, at least on the web. Also, from the webpage source, it appears that the maximum resolution is STILL 1080p, since there is no HDR or 2160p flag.I’d love it like x men days of future past rogue cutMaybe just appreciate the people who created your entertainment?Yes, you’re right,they do a great job restoring them. But please tell me if you read credits?I don\\'t think soThis is a much more elaborate question than you might realize.One one hand, Atmos is a sound technology, and that has nothing to do with the video resolution or image technology of your TV... On the other hand, however I can 100% guarantee you that if your TV is 1080p, it won\\'t pass Atmos.Secondarily, if you\\'re just using TV speakers, Atmos will do virtually nothing. If you have a sound system that supports it, you can buy a streaming device (Like a Roku Ultra or something) and that *might* give you the option.Realisitically though, Atmos is a tad pricey, and franky a bit of the pain in the butt to get all the pieces in place -- and I don\\'t mean this in an insulting way -- if you don\\'t already *know* if you can use Atmos, then your TV/Sound setup probably needs to be swapped out for newer/more premium models.If all of that sounds obnoxious, and you\\'ve just been enjoying things as they are until now, then don\\'t sweat it. If you feel like you\\'ve been wanting a better TV/Movie/Music/Game experience for a while, and sound is important to you, then I can give you advice if you want. Let me know :)Thanks, i should\\'ve explained better..> One one hand, Atmos is a sound technology, and that has nothing to do > with the video resolution or image technology of your TV... This is axactly what i expected> On the other hand, however I can 100% guarantee you that if your TV is > 1080p, it won\\'t pass Atmos.No, of course not> Secondarily, if you\\'re just using TV speakers, Atmos will do virtually nothing. If you have a sound system that supports it, you can buy a streaming device (Like a Roku Ultra or something) and that *might* give you the option.I\\'m using Nvidia Shield and FTV Stick 4k, plugged in directly to a Denon with 5.1.2 setup.> Realisitically though, Atmos is a tad pricey, and franky a bit of the pain in the butt to get all the pieces in place -- and I don\\'t mean this in an insulting way -- if you don\\'t already *know* if you can use Atmos, then your TV/Sound setup probably needs to be swapped out for newer/more premium models.I have 2 outputs.. one is 1080p TV, the other is a 4K HDR Projector. I do get Atmos when using the projector, but only DD+ with the TV. As you said, i thought I\\'d get Atmos no matter what display i used.Yeah that\\'s a much different situation than you originally presented. Running directly into the Denon should let you get Atmos. In that particular configuration, the TV will have zero to do with Atmos.July 10th in the NetherlandsI wonder why it takes months between digital/bluray and D+. Wouldn\\'t it be massive marketing to have it on there or are they counting on bluray sales to bring in the money first?I get that this is a bigger movie, but it\\'s odd they put the date out for it before Maleficent 2 which came out a month prior. June 26 for Frozen 2 in America suggests May for Maleficent.YasThere\\'s never been a better time to be down under, mate.That Into the Unknown doc might come out around the same time as Frozen 2 hitting the service.America gets it a whole month earlier :( dang it stucks sometimes but oh well.i think we nordics will have it to when it launch here in that time i guess in july or so its it.I wonder why we get it a month later than the US “due to existing agreements”. There wasn’t any delay for TS4, Aladdin or The Lion King.Yes its probably because they want blueray to sell aswellYes me too. Are you on PS4?Yep. I am.Me too, sometimes it also glitches and my downloads are corruptedI haven\\'t been able to play movies at 4k/DV quality since the 2/7 update on my TV. Hoping they roll out a fix soon.Can you play Youtube 4k videos at 4k? Does your device have enough bandwidth available to stream Disney Plus 4k video?Yes, I can stream both YouTube and Netflix at 4k resolutions. My devices both also have enough bandwidth too. Very oddIt\\'s likely then that either the bandwidth is insufficient, or your device connecting to the Chromecast isn\\'t negotiating the 4k playback.Check your video quality options in the app too!Ran a speed test on my phone with 90mbps down and 30mbps upload, video quality is set to high in the app too. It’s really stumped me as I recently bought a 4k TV with the ultra chrome cast and was looking forward to watching end game tonight on it.I doubt it. The only things that have a coming soon date are Disney owned movies, because Disney only cares about Movie fans.But x men films are on D+ list for the UK so its not out of the question 😀It might be under “Extras” when it drops, can’t say for certain though.Could be that could be the case 😀GrrrrrDang was really hoping this would turn out greatSome states just passed a bill allowing a tax on streaming services.https://uk.ign.com/articles/disney-plus-announces-full-content-line-up-for-the-uk check this list. I think they all are gonna be on Disney plus.I just hope they release the clone wars episodes the same time as the US. Especially when they announced the Mandalorian would be released weekly.Thanks for that, not sure why I didn\\'t come across that myself. Looks like everything will be available on Disney+ at launch except Rise of Skywalker.I\\'m still wondering if the films will become exclusive to Disney+ though. Going through that content list, if all the films listed as being available become exclusive to Disney+, Sky Cinema is going to take a hell of a hit at the end of the month. Aside from the Star Wars films they currently also have a lot of Marvel films, as well as a bunch of other Disney-owned stuff.What, no Bonkers?! That\\'s literally the reason I wanted Disney+ in the first place. :/ I can\\'t even buy DVDs of that show, because they were never made.Yes, I\\'m pretty disappointed by the Mandalorian announcement. I\\'ve been a good boy and resisted watching it illegally so was planning on binge watching it once D+ launched. I guess they didn\\'t want people to watch it all during their free 7-day trial and then cancel, but it still sucks that I\\'ll have to watch it weekly.Not true, Bonkers the TV series isn\\'t available.It should all be on there the whole 1st season 😀I heard that they will launch Hulu internationally in 2021, I hope it’s in the first half of the yearHopefully Disney just changes their minds and ends up adding all the adult content on the service. I mean we could get R rated but that’s unlikely, but I still hope we can get plenty of PG-13 movies and shows that aren’t always Star Wars and Marvel related.They’re working on releasing Hulu internationally. Won’t be for awhile though so if you want mature content you’ll just have to wait or find another way to watch it.The number of people who get a PG service and then complain about it being PG is ridiculous. It\\'s like ordering a pizza and being upset that it has cheese and tomato sauce on it.That will be Disney\\'s downfall.....subscribers will begin to leave when the teens lose interest...I mean no disrespect here, but I\\'m really confused by the people who signed up for Disney+ genuinely expecting more than a nostalgia trip/family-oriented streaming service. The stuff they have on there already (Avengers: Endgame, the X-Men films, etc.) is about as close to MA as their main brand will get. Disney is all about projecting the image of squeaky-clean, wholesome family entertainment even if that\\'s not the reality. They leave stuff like Sorority Boys to their subsidiaries, making sure the Mouse\\'s fingerprints are nowhere near it while still enjoying the profits. Disney isn\\'t refusing to evolve by sticking to its long-established company tenants, they\\'ve always been this way. If you want adult-themed content, D+ isn\\'t the streaming service for you. I\\'d truly shocked if they added Deadpool (the original, not the Once Upon A Deadpool cut) and featured it proudly next to Frozen. Ideally, customers would be able to check out Deadpool and DuckTales on the same service with proper restrictions in place, but right now their interface is basic and can\\'t even handle that. Also, why only have one streaming service when they can charge you for two (Disney+ for your littles and Hulu for the older members of the household)? I\\'ve been waiting for Hulu for years (since Glee\\'s pilot episode aired) so I get the impatience, but in its absence I don\\'t expect Disney+ to add more mature content that revolves around my wants. That\\'s what Netflix, Amazon, etc. are for and Disney+\\'s target audience (families with young kids) are more enthralled with the fact that they can play Toy Story multiple times a day for the house\\'s obsessed super-fan than they are lamenting the lack of Grey\\'s Anatomy or Pretty Little Liars to watch when the kids are asleep.That’s what Hulu is for!🤷🏻\\u200d♂\\u200d🤷🏻\\u200d♂\\u200dFantasyland needs more killing.Geez. It\\'s a targeted product that expresses that in the pitch. Other targeted products are aimed at different personas. What is hard to understand here?Would it be bundled with Disney + in the likes of UK then?Ahh that makes a lot more sense. Fingers crossed!I agree with this. I actually see no problem with Disney having this type of content on their streaming service. They don\\'t need to advertise it on the home page if they don\\'t want, just have a category that you can select with password protection to watch if you so choose. With Disney allowing mature rated films/TV show to be branded with their own name, I don\\'t see it as much of a stretch. But I guess it\\'s up to them, and how the general public perceives them which is family friendly.Bob Igor from what I read may be working on this as they said they where fixing and sorting it so think they will as india has mature stuff on their D+I\\'m not complaining, I just enjoy consuming a wide variety of content and would like all relative content that is owned by a brand to be under one streaming service.Oh no you mean after this generation grows up there won’t ever be any more kids?I’m locked in for 3 years unfortunately. But after that I’m not renewing anymoreNo it won\\'t.Disney is afraid of evolving. They can\\'t see that people prefer real mature content over kid shows lolI don\\'t know why people aren\\'t getting that.Well they would first need to add said password protection to the service. As it is if you set up a kids profile there is nothing stopping the kids from changing to a different profile...and nothing restricting a person from editing profiles/account settings.what mature stuff is on the Indian disney +?Same. There\\'s nothing to watch on the service I\\'m interested in or I haven\\'t already seen. I haven\\'t seen anything on it Ive wanted to watch since Mandelorian season 1 finished. It\\'s a snooze fest.You seem confident that nothing good is coming yet the release schedule for marvel, star wars and some of the original content was announced for the first two years before you signed up. So why did you sign up?I understand that, but the problem is that Hulu isn\\'t in my country. I can\\'t access it, so I can\\'t get other Disney branded content that has a stricter rating.Not mature but heard they had fox tv shows and that not mature but think game of thrones on hotstar in india so yes bit more mature 😀I gave that movie with the kid, it’s like an original Timmy failure. The movie was so bad.So wait till more stuff comesFor people like you who apparently think they know what I like and take time out of their dying days to respond to me.Hulu isn’t in my country yet.[deleted]lol we\\'re being downvoted for having an opinion even though we\\'re prepaid for 3 years.Yeah, I don\\'t have a choice since I signed up for 3 yearsBut again they gave you a hint of the original content plans and release schedule before the three year deal so what convinced you to sign up for $144 besides the Mandalorian that now somehow hasn\\'t come to pass?I didn\\'t know until posting here that Hulu was going international, that\\'s why I asked the question of what would be happening.Usually old people or workers of the service. I stopped caring.Disney really needs to put all of these shorts into a playlist/show/something. Trying to find all these shorts within the service is an absolute nightmareThe Netherlands has only 10 of these shorts with only 1 added since launch 4 months ago! So it is utterly frustrating to see the US (where there are more than 60 already) get even more.There are about 600 classic Disney shorts. I had expected Disney to add a handful of them every month or so, so that the entire collection would be available after a few years.Weird. I\\'m in the US and I don\\'t see it listed.New or...?I am constantly confused about Disney\\'s decisions. Let\\'s stealth drop a single Donald Duck short film, all by itself, and with no announcement?The worst is the ones that act as extras to movies. Ones like these I can find because they’re listed in the shorts a-z but I do have a script that checks for me. Without that, yeah.According to my script it was a added this afternoon. I don’t recall seeing it previously.Yes, it is.Even more confusing is why the content disparity between regions for the shorts. Australia has very few classic shorts, though it seems they have added some more recently, but they are missing still most of my favourites.I think they have a bunch of monkeys just pressing buttons. If they are going to stealth drop content why not the entire Mickey Mouse Club 90s run? Or Ant Farm and Dog with A Blog lolProbably not. March 24 is when Disney+ here legally has the rights to show the likes of marvel films and stuff etc without getting into a brawl with SkyWhen it was first announced, March 31st was the launch date and they already moved it up a week.Oh yes completely forgot thats true I’ve heard greys anatomy may be on uk d+ 😀That is true but would be nice as india got it but just excited 😀Doubt. It’s on Amazon video and they just renewed their rights for it like in the last 6 months.Ahhh ok someone had said so maybe next year i just want rogue cut of x men days of future past 😀Even more disappointing: many of these shows are not even made available in non-US markets. Seeing all the updates and additions they get there really makes me feel like a second-class customer (while paying the same price).I know right and us cartoon series fans are 3rd class citizens.Same.Same issue here...You do not really \"register\" devices, Disney Plus keeps a record of the last known devices used for playback. This could include browser (sessions).Contact Disney Plus Help if you can\\'t log in.Maybe it is playing but too small to see ;):( :)I would like to know if also.I don’t think so. You can’t even disable a device.What do you mean?*Can you see if you left your phone in the bathroom?* **No**.*Can Disney Plus see if your AppleTV is within the supported regions?* **Yes**.I think that mean can they see what devices are logged and where those devices are located. For example, with email you can see where the account was logged in and the location.I think he says:I did things no one should have to do, it will haunt me forever.I just watched on my PS4 Disney+ and the subtitles were there.The exact quote is:“I did things no dog should do.  They will haunt me forever.”Why would they censor that and not uh....Bart\\'s little helper?If your tv is widescreen orientation it could be that the actual video is just cut off.  I\\'ve heard that a lot of Simpsons gags are somewhat destroyed in the transition to widescreen televisions.What country are you in? The “forced subtitles” may only automate in some countries.Huh, when I watched it last week, the subtitles were on there.I watched it last week and it was there. I live in the US btw.It had the subtitles in the cinemas for that scene but every time I watched the dvd it wouldn’t show what Santa was barking unless I had subtitles on. I imagine a similar scenario here, it shows what he says when subtitles are turned on.Disney + is odd, theres an episode in season thats missing the couch gag[deleted]Huh, maybe it’s my Xbox or tv. Thanks for posting so I don’t have to look up what he said either way, much appreciated 👍🏻Disney + is so inconsistent. The X-Men movies are on there and their f bombs are uncensored... Yet it is in another movie I think it is censored*The Simpsons Movie* was made in 2.39:1 anamorphic widescreen.As to the series, not “a lot” of jokes were cropped out. The pics everyone shows have been floating around since the HD versions premiered in 2012 and those are really the only major examples Of jokes getting. You can probably count the missing jokes from 20 years on your fingers. That said, the shot composition is pretty obviously off in many scenes and the very early Klasky-Csupo years  were cropped tight and seem almost fisheye.That said, I expect once given the choice, a solid 95% will still watch the 16:9 HD version, bad cropping and all. [https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/simpsons-jokes-gags-cropped-aspect-ratio.html](https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/simpsons-jokes-gags-cropped-aspect-ratio.html)The movie was made in widescreen.And on Hulu, you still have censored episodes of Family Guy but uncensored episodes of South Park!  You can see Bart\\'s wiener in the Simpsons movie, but the first 19 seasons are still cropped.  \"Look at me, I\\'m the mascot of an evil corporation!\"They X-men movies aren\\'t on there, at least not yet. Just the cartoons.Exactly I feel like they should\\'ve just merged this with Hulu then made it available everywhere elseThey\\'re on there in Canada all uncensoredThey are on there...Unless they\\'re on it outside of the US; searching for them only brings up the three animated series.Yeah my bad I should\\'ve specified that it\\'s CanadaIs it coming to us soon? It’d be nice to watch those. Also is it under the marvel tab or do you have to search for them?I\\'m in the UK so I wouldn\\'t know sadly, I just heard about the movies being on there and uncensored. And yes its in the Marvel tabIt’s just over a month between Big Hero 6 The Series season 2 final airing and it going on Disney plus ([source](https://www.vulture.com/article/new-on-disney-plus-movies-shows.html))I imagine a similar time frame for Tangled season 3.Per Twitter, it\\'s coming April 23. Sorry, they didn\\'t link a source, but I buy it. I personally thought it would be early April, but this\\'ll do.Can\\'t wait for the cord-cutters to finally see it. Amazing series finale.Urgh ok coolOof. OkCancel until they add an Off setting for that nonsense.Not in the US.I can’t find it in ausNot in the Netherlands of course.Sorry to get hopes up! I’m located in Canada.[2]I\\'m assuming the new Cosmos season won\\'t be on Disney Plus, until the entire season has finished at the earliest. I think it\\'s time to end this kind of a delay and stop giving exclusive first run access to linear cable channels. Disney has already started next day access to new FX series episodes on Hulu, so they should do the same with Nat Geo and Disney+.Cosmos: Possible Worlds will be available 1-2 months after it has finished airing. (Like with most shows on the platform)How are they going to have the third season on there if they don\\'t even have the show on there? Unless if they are going to have it on there after it\\'s done on the tv.Mostly agree, but they still have to give people a reason to subscribe to the cable channel / companies to justify keeping it on their channel lineup. I think a week delay would be the best compromise, although I also like the rumor they may air Disney+ series on TV a few months delayed (like I’ve heard rumor that The Mandalorian might air on ABC this summer).Yeah see, that’s what I’d do.  Put it on a paid service with no ads and then graduate it down to a basic cable service that has ads.to fix it right click the ublock icon in chrome and click options.&#x200B;go to whitelist and add \"www.[disneyplus.com](https://disneyplus.com)\" in a new line with no quotesIt\\'s already whitelisted and still does it.Edit: It\\'s not disneyplus you need to whitelist it\\'s both; www.disneyplus.com bam-sdk-configs.bamgrid.com * allowwww.disneyplus.com bamgrid.com * allowI whitelisted only www.disneyplus.com and it works for me now. Not sure why you have to do more than oneYeah I\\'m not sure either but thanks for mentioning to check whitelist decided to just trial and error with the other urls and those two worked after doing it.If Disney is turning Jerry Spinelli books into movies, I’m hoping to see Crash next.Really inspiring to see the girl who won America\\'s got talent to go on and star in this, good for her.Gonna see this on the Disney lot on Wednesday!!!Trying to decide if I should read the book first...?Is it about a manic pixie dream girl like the trailer seems to imply?I\\'ve never heard of it before nowThis was my favorite book in middle school!! Haven’t read it since then and I’m so excited for this movieIs that Grace Vanderwaal?I just re-read it in anticipation of the movie and am excited to see what they do with it!Are there two stargirl things happening right now?Middle schoolI remember reading it in 5th and tbh I didn’t like it very much. But that was 11 years ago (damn I’m old!) so maybe my opinion would change if I read it again.Oh my gosh! I loved this bookNew hit song by The WeekDyMe too, manI read it in middle school and loved it! Hope this is good!I read it in middle school and have waited 15 years to  see a movie of it haha! It may be way out of my age range but I can\\'t wait to see it.Oh, my gosh! That was one of the *best* books ever! (And one of the few that I think can be well adapted to film!)Damn, I didn’t think Gone Girl needed a prequel but here we are.When is this coming?I read the book when I was in middle school. It was a pretty good book, but honestly I prefer the movie. It was sooooo beautiful. I criedJust watched this, was amazing!That looks like a young Olsen twin.She should have never beaten John Dorenbos. Travesty.What\\'s this about?NopeD+ seems like the perfect platform for this stuff: do the Wrinkle in Time sequels too because it’s not going to be profitable at the box office.Crash was my favorite book in fifth gradeI came to the comments just to find out if it was her. Thanks!thing is she sucks tho lolLucky!! Is that kind of like a premiere with the cast attending?I defintely recommend it. The sequel, Love Stargirl, is very good too.It’s a great book! It’s a lot about being nonconformist and your true self.I just read the [wikipedia entry about the book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargirl_(novel)), because I didn\\'t know anything about it. Your description is exactly what it is. This show is going to be a hard no for me.That was my concern as well. The MPDG is a trope that the younger generations really didn\\'t need.YesYes, there are. The other one, based on the DC comics character, will be on the DC Universe app and the next day on the CW network.Good, hopefully it doesn\\'t disappoint. We want you to enjoy a good movie, possibly great or maybe even masterpiece.This Friday.I wouldn\\'t mind seeing sequels to Wrinkle in Time. I actually liked that movie.Oh, if they\\'re going that route, they could do the *Chronicles of Crestomanci* series as well! I hope they do!I’m not exactly sure! I have a D23 Gold membership and they always have cool events (some included in price, some not). I tend to always miss them as they don’t notify and they’re first come first serve but I got lucky this time! I’ll let you know if it’s that kind of thing!Wrinkle in Time blew well beyond my expectations. I never read the book and I probably never will but that movie was so good.There are like 4 or 5 other books that come after it. I had to read Wrinkle in Time in Jr. High but I re-read it again before the movie came out. Of course, the book is better (and my favorite version of the story is the graphic novel adaptation) but I immensely enjoyed the movie and don\\'t understand why it got so much hate.Probably because it wasn\\'t very good. Interesting to see so many liked it, I was beyond disappointed and my granddaughters were bored. Loved the booksThere\\'s a graphic novel adaptation? Could you tell me by whom? I\\'d like to look it up.The graphic novel is amazing, and lived up to all my expectations!Hope Larson.Thank you!I have enjoyed it as an adult too! I think it’s cute and tells a story we don’t often see. It’s corny sometimes, but in all the right wholesome places.Atmos is working on mine. StrangeIt works on App Version 1.3 On 1.4 it\\'s gone again.(Manually downgraded to 1.3 and works again)Disable your adblockSame hereI’m more pissed they haven’t fixed the aspect ratio yet or updated when they willThey didn\\'t. The creator Matt Groening (creator) made the decision to not make it available anywhere.Now im curious (youtubes this episode)Ye idk why they got rid of itIt’s dumb but it’s only the one episodeThey added it back to Simpsons world months laterYea. I was very disappointed in that decision. Im not gonna get into it cause idk wanna argue but theres no definite proof that MJ was a Pedo. Also theres so many other celebs who starred in the show and have dome horrible things but they dont remove those episodes.But if they made a new Tron show, that might cut into the budget for the Gaston origin story! We can\\'t be having *that* now....They’re building a Tron attraction at Walt Disney World. Just because they didn’t move forward with one particular concept for Disney+ doesn’t mean Tron is dead and buried.I actually don’t think this is fair.The project wasn’t green light by Disney. The creators worked on it for a few months before getting the okay. It was presented to Disney and they didn’t choose to go through with it.It was given the okay and then cancelled. Totally different.Or they can do what they want with their IP.Yes! Now thats a big no no! HahaWith that being said. Tron to me has been dead since 2010 after several rumors of being cancelled to delayed indefinitely.I do believe the attraction coming in at Orlando is a wonderful step forward but to me as of right now. I\\'d say Disney is burying the franchise.If that is true, my original point stands. Which is Disney has yet to give Tron a decent marketing campaign that they do for the other franchises.Edit: took out something that could be taken out of context.Or they could please their fans that have die hard loved the IP for everything it represent rather than building them up every other month with empty promises and/or rumors that turned false in the end.Before you select play on the title\\'s page, it will either say 4K, HD, or neither. It will automatically play at the highest quality listed. Seems some devices do not support 4K. I noticed my PS4 Pro does not display in 4K but my Xbox One doesDepends on the TV as well. Currently mine won\\'t play 4k nor Dolby Vision despite it being listed.Depends on your tv some of them such as Roku TVs have an icon that pops up whenever HDR 4k content is being played on tv.Weird. We didn’t have this issue when we watched it in JanuaryWhere are you located at?  I just went into my app (I’m in the US) and it shows all three seasons as being available (and I started playing S3 ep10 to test).  If you are elsewhere, then I’d think you’d get it eventually since it is here.Im in Canada (Ontario)i would say it’s pretty likely. planet of the apes was a key asset in Disney’s buyout of Fox.They will probably come eventuallyThe new ones are on Hulu. I don\\'t think Disney will put them on D+ as they does deal with some themes that are not very family friendly.But Disney is supposed to be working on a new reboot of the franchise, and they might make that fit the Disney brand. if not, it will be marketed as Fox, and probably also placed on Hulu.I think the original films gel with the classic film selection on Disney+ already like 20000 Leagues Under the Sea and The Sound of Music. Similarly I’d expect All About Eve, The King and I, South Pacific, The Hustler, Cleopatra, Titanic, and Mrs Doubtfire and others like it to show up on Disney+ in the future.Surprising that Friends had only a single quarter as the most popular show.Game of Thrones was a force of nature.I had no idea NCIS was so popular for so long. Crazy.Did “24” pop up at all?That was awesome.I’ve only watched all of 3 shows (unless I missed some, which is entirely possibly).Friends, which I haven’t watched in years,The West Wing, which I love and did a rewatch of just last year,and Stranger Things. I’m in Australia (born in 1987), so that definitely affected the shows I had access to as a kid.It would be interesting to know how many shows people had watched in their entirety. Especially the ones that went for 10+ years.Kinda sad to see that The Simpson’s was never on that list. Must have more of cult following than I thought.Boy, in the 90s NBC was king, but once ER and Friends ended they havent had anything of significance, aside from SNF and season 1 of Heroes, lol. Ratings wise of course. the Office and Parks and Rec are wonderfulIm surprised How I Met Your Mother didnt make an appearance on that list at allThe Simpsons never made it in there?? I’m surprisedAlways great to see the x files’ numbers during their run/heyday.How can The mandalorian be watched by 28 million when Disney+ does not even have 28 million users?How did Coach fall down to number ten then all of a sudden spike up again?Who\\'s Da Boss? What logo is that?It\\'s Who\\'s **THE** Boss?And the answer is Mona.I\\'ve never watched GoT.  AMA.The shows that Disney owns are  Roseanne, The Golden Girls, Empty Nest,  Home Improvement,  NYPD Blue,  The X-Files,  Desperate Housewives, Lost, Grey\\'s Anatomy,Prison Break,  Castle,  Modern Family, This Is UsWhy anyone likes the Big Bang theory will always baffle meNot really when you consider the behemoths that were Home Improvement and Seinfeld. What sticks out to me is how insane Game of Thrones’ run was. To be on a *premium* channel and not one of the “Big 4” and to churn out those numbers. It didn’t even fall out of the top 5 despite not airing for almost 2 years hahaAlso, \"The Office\" never appears on the list. Is the possible with how popular the show was?Imagine what it could have been had D&D not given up.I always remember seeing it as the top show for its time frame but it’s shocking how long it’s stayed right at the top. Like it’s a really good show! But I also feel like I never hear anyone talking about it.And with almost the same cast for much of it too, a few additions along the way for sure, but that’s why it was such a big deal with one of the core left the show.No, 24 was never a top ten show. Highest it ever reached was #20.Almost all of them are very American sit-coms so that makes sense if you\\'re in Australia. Some are pretty good but most range from mediocre to utter garbage. Crime shows took off in the late 90\\'s/early 00\\'s and the last 15 years has seen dramas become a lot more popular, but bad sit-coms still rake in the views with older people.Fox was pretty brand new at the time when Simpsons was at its peak. Wasn\\'t in as many homes right away. It took quite a while to achieve that but by that time The Simpsons had been on the air for quite a while and it wasn\\'t the cultural phenomenon it had been.NBC has never recovered since Friends left. Their must see Thursday line-up continued to boast excellent shows (The Office, Parks & Rec, 30 Rock) that were critically acclaimed but they just didn\\'t have the mainstream popularity of their previous shows (all of them became massively successful on streaming when they went off the air).HIMYM was also one of those shows that was facing the threat of cancellation for its first couple of seasons. It ended up running way longer than the creators expected, which is why they stuck with the ending they came up with (and partially filmed) at the end of season two even though it didn\\'t fit the story that ultimately played out across multiple years of television.HIMYM is one of those shows that grew in popularity near the end of its run and since it\\'s been over but while it was on the air it didn\\'t do very well. In fact, I remember most people not giving it a chance because they assumed it was another Friends wannabe. Took a few years for people to realize it wasn\\'t & was a great show on its own merit.X Files was HUGE back in the day. Always forget just how big it truly was.They actually do now. 28.6 mil to be exactPeople share accounts plus it’s stream illegally so the numbers might be higherIt says that the numbers on the newer shows includes data for P2P audience viewership as well. I\\'ve heard, especially with the Mandalorian, P2P is a big portion of the viewing audience (and a big problem). I don\\'t have Disney+, never did, but I\\'ve seen every episode of Mando. I\\'d venture to guess I\\'m far from alone, so it makes sense to me...These shows certainly don\\'t like piracy, but they don\\'t close their eyes and ears to it either. They want to know if people are viewing their shows, whether or not it\\'s legitimately - the data is valuable to them. It\\'s not hard for them to track the number of seeders and leachers on a P2P episode upload, anyone who has used torrents know that the data is easily visible. The total number of individuals who become seeders are the number of completed downloads, assumingly, that would be 1 viewer.*Edit* there you go, as the person below be said, as of Feb 3, there were 28.6 million subscribers.Global or US?Syndication?What do you think about the droid attack on the Wookies?Disney doesn’t own NBCdo they? How could they own This Is Us?... and then to do us that dirty.The Office and Friends both got way more popular on Netflix than they were as they were airing. They were extremely popular at the time obviously, but that was also just a more competitive time for TV in general.The office was not popular during its initial run. NBC was losing the ratings war constantly during those years. It got much more popular via syndication.Their data is sketchy at bestIn terms of ratings... probably about the same?Not trying to defend D&D or those last seasons, but I honestly don\\'t know any people who stopped watching it that late in the game.Cause it attracts a much older demographic that aren\\'t talking about it on social mediaCrazy how it never cracked top 10, yet is more influential and has more staying power than many of the shows that did.Yeah, which is also my suspicion on the numbers for Game of Thrones. Shows like it, The Walking Dead, and Breaking Bad had huge P2P audiencesThey had it comin.NBC is the network they are on. They own the distribution rights.Yeah, I actually never watched the office as it was airing, only in syndication and then on Netflix.It faced the threat of cancellation many times during the first few seasons. It was only after the other big name Thursday night NBC comedies left the slate that it became the anchor of the night and even then, its numbers were only great in comparison to shows like Community and 30 Rock.By then, it was too late for people to stop watching. We were all so optimistic it\\'d end the way we wanted it to end but they pulled one over us.Rewatch the show without having to wait a year between seasons and, by the end of season 6, it\\'s very obvious that they had no idea what to do with the show or how to end it. I waited until 6 weeks before the final episode to start watching and seemingly experienced a very different show compared to people that watched from day 1.Rewatch the show without having to wait a year between seasons and, by the end of season 6, it\\'s very obvious that they had no idea what to do with the show or how to end it.

And call the bank that issued the credit card to report it stolen, and they will stop any future charges on it and issue a new card with new number. Also, if it is a credit card, and not a debit card, you might even be able to get any charges reversed from payment on your D+ account after the account was hacked. The bank will send you an affidavit to fill out and return. And even if it is a debit card, still call your bank and report it. At least no new charges will be applied to it. You might also be able to recover any charges made after it was hacked (depends on laws where you live and your bank policy).If you are going to ask if I have tried power cycling, i have.The login Button started doing this when I power cycled my wifi router.Turn off ublock and try againThank you so much my good sirThe New Marvel Animated Universe should be as good as The Clone Wars. That is, if they will be a MAU.Aren’t all the recent cartoons in the same universe?Kind of, but there is no set continuity or anything since all of these shows contradict each other and themselves at times. And they\\'re not the most critically acclaimed or fan loved bunch or anything. All of them are currently over except for Spider-Man which still has a season of 6 hour long episodes to air. Whenever it seems as though there will be a pretty good Marvel animated universe, things get in the way. What I wouldn\\'t have given for a universe made up of Avengers Earth\\'s Mightiest Heroes, Spectacular Spider-Man, Wolverine and the X-Men and Fantastic Four World\\'s Greatest Heroes. Fingers crossed that they finally knock it out of the park in the near future.I don’t like any of the new cartoons and I am not super familiar with them so I was sure.That being said, if you haven’t already you should check out Avengers Earths Mightiest Heroes which is already on Disney+. Best modern Avengers cartoon by FAR. Similar to the DC cartoons of the 90’s/00’s. There are also two cartoons that are loosely, supposedly in the same canon (Wolverine & the X Men, and Spectacular Spider-Man) that are worth checking out as well if you enjoy EMH. But those two are not on D+ I believe.I own both Spectacular Spider-Man, and Wolverine and The X-Men. Both series are underrated and got canceled before their prime.Not entirely sure about Spectacular Spider-Man, but Wolverine and the X-Men does share a universe with EMH, along with a couple DTV movies.It\\'s still early 2020. It\\'s going to be early 2020 for the next few months.Their fixing it as we speak. It’s a significant process and that type of work has to be outsourced to another company.I\\'m about to cancel my plan. Mandalorian and pre season 10 Simpsons was all I really wanted out of this service. The nostalgia wore off quick and I can\\'t enjoy my favorite Simpsons I grew up watching on a tube tv in fake 4k. But I know the minute I cancel Disney will put up the 4:3 hahaIt’s possible they are fixing it as I speak, but not ready to deliver. I mean, do you realize how many episodes their team has to go through in order to keep their promise?I thought they said at some point it\\'ll be out by the time Disney plus comes out in the UK which is towards the end of this monthIf not then some point this yearPlz stop asking about this. Sincerely everyoneThey said sometime this year.I don\\'t think Disney+ does anything with our feedback.. Of many series the Dutch language is missing on the Dutch version, a lot of series are out of order etc.. I provided this feedback in September 2019, during the pilot period in the Netherlands..If Disney were smart, they’ll release it before the UK release because all of the residents that live there know of this issue.it might end up being early 2020 for the next year and a halfMaybe this is a stupid question, but what\\'s so complicated that they need another company to fix it? Can\\'t they just use the original aspect ratio?FXX\\'s Simpson\\'s World had the episodes available in both aspect ratios since 2015. It\\'s barely a process at all, they just need to upload the files and make a button in the menu.[deleted]Fr exactlyI don\\'t think it\\'s the content that is the issue. The old Simpsons World app defaulted to 16:9 HD, but had the option of the 4:3 SD video source. It had the ability to switch video streams much like we can change audio tracks on most streaming services. Nothing about Disney+ so far shows they have that capability on the back end (few video services do). There is a lot of other content that we hope gets added, Simpsons World had all the old DVD commentary tracks.Hopefully they’ll fix it for the UK release in 2 weeks!“Over time, Disney+ will roll out new features and additional viewing options. As part of this, in early 2020, Disney+ will make the first 19 seasons (and some episodes from Season 20) of ‘The Simpsons’ available in their original 4:3 aspect ratio, giving subscribers a choice of how they prefer to view the popular series.They said that Nov. 16. They have not addressed it since. No further details or timeline. No clarification for “early 2020.” No one promised it for the UK except wishful fans. We’ll all find out together.The only reason I look at this sub is to find out when this is gettin fixed so speak for yourself bubNoEarly 2020 is the first quarter to half of the year. They have until June at the latest.[removed]There is a lot of work that goes into making each episode able to be put on the platform. That process requires a variety of third party companies to do it and has to be replicated across all languages Disney plus will service now and in the future.[deleted]My guess is that they are doing fresh scans of the material, which could explain why it’s taking so long. I’m being optimistic here.A. If you are subscribed to Disney Plus, you could check for yourself. B. If you were actually that much of a Simpsons fan, you’d be watching it on Disney+ anyway.I dunno. 1989 lasted for at *least* four years.But Disney isn\\'t contractually obligated to meet their own deadline. I expect ~~their~~ there are a lot more service delivery/back-end issues that have a higher ROI. Besides as someone who has been through several CEOs...new CEO, new priorities.Edit: is the 3d or 4th time I have typed \"their\" instead of \"there\" in comment. I leaving this up here to embarrass myself to get out of whatever mental block I got intoI don\\'t believe you, for reasons that are obvious.It took them two years to master the 2012 versions on there now, and those were upscaled and de-noised from the DVD masters. But, in theory, there should be a 1440x1080 version sitting around someone\\'s hard-drive.Not gonna watch it with it cropped. It ruins the showI am a true simpsons fan in fact thats why i prefer watcjing it on the dvds instead of disney+This is true, I was there. And 1984 is still going on.I wasn\\'t born yet, so I wouldn\\'t know lol>But Disney isn\\'t contractually obligated to meet their own deadlineThey have a contract with themselves that they have to honor? That\\'s the equivalent of someone making a weekend to do list and not getting through the whole list. There are hundreds of episodes to go through. It\\'s their service, and as far as I can see it they\\'ll get to it when they get to it. They said early 2020. That can be anywhere from January to June. They\\'ve got at least 4 months (March, April, May, June) before anyone has a good reason to complain. But then again it\\'s their service so if they want to push it back to late 2020, or early 2021, or whenever, they can.[deleted]I\\'m confused. Are you agreeing with me or are you disagreeing with me?June is not \"early 2020\".Cool story.It\\'s more like mid 2020 but can still be considered the early part of 2020. Anything after that is mid to late 2020.[deleted]Early, Mid, Late. 12 months/3 = Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr / May, Jun, Jul, Aug / Sep, Oct, Nov, DecOh no, have I been downvoted by Bob Iger’s nephew? What shall I do?As I said, early 2020 is the first quarter of the year. However, months are 30 days (obviously not all). So by the time April is over, it\\'s already into mid year territory if going by months. But math considers 91 days from the new year as being the early part of the year (365/4). And that is approaching this weekend. That\\'s why I consider early 2020 to mean anything up to mid 2020 which would include June.With the way things are going, with the virus and everything being delayed, I don\\'t see why this wouldn\\'t be delayed to at least until June. Also, why are you digging up a post from *two* weeks ago?Looking for these two shows either digitally or on a streaming app like Disney plus. Is this here?Do you have Disney Plus and have you used the search option, and if so, what country are you in? The latter could be a limiting factor.>\\tI was looking for the episode on lost tomb of alexander. But not getting much help from google search.Are you sure that it\\'s a part of a series and not a standalone movie?[removed]If you have a European Disney+ account then you will see your home country\\'s catalogue when you\\'re abroad (in another European country).Per EU law, yes. But there is a stipulation, your \"home country\" is verified to your credit card billing address. If  that credit card address changes then you are no longer guaranteed the \"home\" version. BTW, the CC address thing is the same for Netflix.A caveat, I\\'m not sure if or how Brexit may eventually affect this.Simply contact Disney+ customer support, they can force change your region on your account to match to your new address. Just simply verify with the agent over the phone where you moved to and done.Yes if you purchase the uk version you will be able to watch the content.I have been having this issue as well on PS4, very frustrating.I guess no one knows how to fix this 🤷🏽\\u200d♂\\u200dIve actually given up on it, not worth logging in everyday with a ps4 controller,  let my lady do it if she wants to use it lolThey’re already making an Ice Age series for Disney Plus. It’ll be a spin-off centered around Buck the Weasel.I would love that so I could build custom lit of shows that re not in my preferred order (Disney afternoon shows that feature the pilot movie in the middle of a season)Tom is looking jacked. Look at bottom left, those some pecs.Is that Owen Wilson in the hood? I saw that he’s in the show but is that him?*Lowkey* set photos.A friend is working on this and I went to visit her last weekend.  Took so much restraint not asking her juicy detailsDoes... does he have job?Looks like he’s investigating a crime. Finally, they’re going the police procedural route I have always wanted.What\\'s up with those uniforms? Is Loki joining Cobra?If there are set photos, they must not be keeping the filming very *Lo-ki*Haha awesomeNew Rockstars has entered the chat*Lowkey* set photos.Wow. Actors standing somewhere. Incredible[deleted]I hope Matt Damon made it off Asgard before it went asplody during Ragnarok.I think soCertainly appears soDoes this make it a Loki leaki?I think he\\'s captured to correct timeline related fuckery he\\'s responsible forNot anymore.Looks awesomeThat\\'s probably the TVA. They have a similar logo and colors as the coveralls Loki was wearing in the trailer.The Time Variance AuthorityWyAgreed. Stanley Ipkiss forevaProbably because he died?Twitter videos are in 4:3 by defaultThat\\'s not 4:3, that\\'s 9:16.That’s square because it’s a video for viewing on mobile, that’s all.No, I think that\\'s 3:4.I suspect Disney let their option on Dick Tracy expire decades ago (they never owned the IP).YesWarren Beatty could even do the voice again.I never even watched Dick Tracy but I\\'d watch the heck out of thisWhy does it bother you?Going by Wikipedia: \"As of 2019, the film is now owned by Universal Pictures through DreamWorks Animation under their ownership of DreamWorks Classics, which holds the rights to much of the Filmation catalog, including this film. \"Fox probably just handled video distribution for it.I looooved this movie as a kid! But not as much as I loved this version of Pocahontas lol: https://m.imdb.com/title/tt1125875/?ref_=fn_al_tt_9well yes but maybe they bought the rightsi wish they did this with hulu and expanded that internationally instead of launching an entirely seperate service. it’s nice to have everything in one place.Let\\'s hope the modded Hotstar apk doesn\\'t stop working & video-audio quality increases. Hotstar\\'s security is really bad & the video quality is even worser for showsHotstar is not a new service actually. It was launched in India in 2015 mostly for live Cricket but it had expanded since to become one of the most widely used streaming services in India. Disney got ownership of Hotstar after they acquired 21st Century Fox assets.It\\'s the exact same app even now. They just changed the look a little bit and yes the video playback issues still exist. I hope they improve the video playback issues by the time Disney Plus launches.yes i am aware. i meant that i wished Disney would’ve added Disney+ as part of hulu like they have done with hotstar.They integrated Disney Plus with Hotstar because it\\'s cheap and people will buy this more compared to the higher subscription prices in US & Europe. You have to understand that there are 35 video streaming services in India with a lot of quality content and launching Disney Plus as a standalone service would have been a fatal mistake in India. Netflix has managed to get close to just 2 million subscriptions in 4 years so I guess it was clever to not make the same mistake as Netflix made it in India.It started happening to me also recently. Using Chrome with uBlock Origin extension. It\\'s always worked fine until a couple of days ago where it needs to be disabled for the login button to workFigured out the issue. Brave has this feature called shields and it basically blocks ads and other harmful stuff. When I turned off shields Disney+ began working again. Kind of concerning...I\\'m having the exact problem with Chrome on Linux.  Looks like we\\'re not the only ones: [https://downdetector.com/status/disney-plus/](https://downdetector.com/status/disney-plus/)Try again on a known compatible browser.For me it just takes a couple of secondsMine works after I spam click log in and wait for like 30secondsThat’s odd. I used to have that problem on Brave. It must be a setting you need to change or browser update because now when I go to D+ it auto logs in for me so I don’t have that issue anymore.It happens to me too.😢 Try looking for \"Disney+ login\" and go straight to that page.They added something the adblockers are not letting through. No doubt some invasive tracking.I have the exact same issue on Chrome, I\\'ve tried clearing cache data and enabling ads to no effect.I\\'ve got it working on internet explorerNow I\\'m using adguard DNS and it won\\'t let me log in eitherI take it the Disney+ app will only be available to DL on and after the 24th March and not before in the UK?Just started encountering this problem today on Firefox with uBlock Origin enabled. Had to disable uBlock for the rest of the page to load. Couldn\\'t access any other pages on the site either. Well played, Disney.Tou a esa loiua caiso nu evra?Happens in the uk aswellWho uses Brave browserSame for me. Disabled uBlock Origin and it\\'s working for me nowDisney+ is running some very serious DRM, encryption and security scripts in the background, to the point that there are devices that can\\'t comply with its requests, resulting in app failures.  I wouldn\\'t be surprised if Brave was blocking the full extent of the DRM the site requires.That’s because the service is not yet available. Just wait a couple of weeks more..People that care about privacy.Yeah, it grabs a ton of info when you try to log in. My entire apartment complex was locked out of Disney Plus at launch because our ISP\\'s IP Address didn\\'t show as being in the right area.If somebody want your data they are going to get itLolThis has been the issue since the launch. Progress doesn\\'t get saved with an web browser for me too;It will not. You must be in a country that supports the service to use abroad.You can\\'t stream, so download before you go.Cancel your subscription before you leave the us if you\\'re moving. (There is no way of contacting disney plus support abroad, I had my subscription go on for almost three months after I moved out of the us.)If not just download what you want to seeBetter download some things before you leave.Anything you download will be fine to watch. Streaming won’t be available unfortunately.I sadly realized that it doesn’t workt while traveling in Chile :(Wow you can\\'t cancel online? Really?Really!! You can\\'t even access anything online. The website does not work or anything. I had to call internationally to be able to reach them, my bill was stupidly highWell, thanks for the tip thenNo, but why would you not? It’s the most popular film series of all time for a reason. If you like the Mandalorian you will like the films, and vice versa.Not really no. There\\'s references and stuff but nothing that would make the plot unable to be understoodThe Mandalorian is a show on its on, with a few references to the films but that’s really it. My brother watched the show and ended up loving it despite never watching a Star Wars film and of course having the knowledge of characters such as Yoda and Darth Vader and knowing about the storm troopers and such already.I think most of the references are just from pop culture, and you would understand them without really watching the movies. You probably know who Yoda is, so you can understand the impact of \"Baby Yoda\" (that itself has made it into pop culture that I\\'m not giving anything away just mentioning that). And the Mandalorian people origins are not covered in the movies, so that\\'s not anything you will be missing by not seeing the movies. The only thing you really will be missing is the time frame reference. It takes place after Episode VI and before Episode VII (this is an [older timeline](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/bf/66/5b/bf665ba237641df4a99966d9c55443e9.png), before Mandalorian came out, but you can see the gap in the timeline between Episode VI and Episode VII).There are also references that go even deeper than the movies, into some of the animated series and canon books. I never got much into those, and just watched the movies, and these references were no distraction for me.[deleted]I think the series is made in a way that people who don’t like the movies can still like the series.There is a nicer feeling to it, imoNot really true, considering the flashbacks.It looks like the UK will miss out on quite a lot of more ‘classic’ Disney content compared to the USA. This is the same for the Netherlands, and for France as well. Missing content includes:- Bonkers series- TaleSpin series- Hercules series- Emperor’s New School series- Mickey Mouse Club series- The Adventures of Spin and Marty series- various Walt-era specials, such as ‘Disneyland Through the Seasons’All this material was made available at launch in the US. In the Netherlands we have been waiting for it for four months now; I have given up hope that we will ever get it. Now and then we see other films from the 50s-80s being added in the US, so far these have not been added here. A similar thing could happen for the UK (although subtitling would not be necessary, which could be an advantage).A positive point for the UK: they seem to be getting a larger selection of classic animated shorts than the lousy 10 we were given in the Netherlands. Also titles as Doug (series) and The Rescuers are on the list for launch, these are inexplicably missing in the Netherlands.The frustating thing here is that Disney does NOT offer an explanation for the missing content. The customer service (while very polite) can only give the tired ‘content is licensed elsewhere’ excuse. This is of course total nonsense for a title like the 1955 Mickey Mouse Club and for most of this other old content as well! My hunch is that Disney  expects that European fans will not miss this content. Well, they are wrong.I just call it \"US only club\". If you\\'re not a yank, you can\\'t enjoy this content because no-one but you cares. It\\'s very alienating and at least Netflix has UK exclusive shows.Basically:Netflix: Here\\'s your *insert country here* exclusive Netflix shows.Disney+: You finally have a butchered version of our service, be happy with what you have, you non-American scum.Worst part is, Bonkers never got a single DVD release.Thank you so much for telling me 🙏You know, I wouldn’t care if I have to wait one or two years for this content. Fine with me, as long as we will eventually get it. In the meantime there is plenty to enjoy. But the fact that Disney refuses to communicate about this is simply infuriating.You’re welcome! Note that I can only tell you how it currently is for the Netherlands; I am not sure what this will mean for the UK exactly. Maybe things will get better when Disney+ launches in more European markets. Maybe a big push is planned to give us this classic content after all. Here’s hoping!Because they assume everyone watches it for the Movies. Plus even if it does take two years, I could have watched everything I wanted illegally by then, because Disney+ refuses to communicate. It\\'s on them for not making the service worthwhile, even with the discount.I hate this so much. It feels like I have to fight for my right to watch something completely legally. Honestly, a lot of these options I only have illegal means left because Disney refuses to care.Hey, at least they’re trying 🤷🏾\\u200d♂\\u200d That’s the most courteous and polite customer support situation I’ve ever heard.A costumer support that isn’t as stale as normal? I’ll take that any dayI would die laughing if they did some Yoda quote...  \"Your account ready it is\" or \"Credit card info updating it needs\"Probably shouted it to make sure their supervisor heard them.They have a script they have to read.  Don\\'t take it out on the staff.God forbid they try to have some harmless fun with their gruelling job, right?Better than interacting with a human robot, that\\'s for sure.You set the output to 720p, but the app streams the maximum resolution available for your connection.Sorry about your troubles but thanks for confirming my belief that 4K streaming is not viable based on my current data usage with 1 TB monthly data cap from my ISP.  With your 7 GB/hr 4K stream usage I estimate I would go from about 600 GB/month to 3600 GB/month if I exclusively streamed 4K video.I\\'m with you, it\\'s absolutely ridiculous that Disney+ still doesn\\'t have a way to limit the quality (it\\'s also absolutely ridiculous that ISP\\'s can have datacaps).  I\\'m honestly considering canceling because the bills for going over our cap makes Disney+ too expensive.We had to cancle D+ because of this. I live in a rural area and get maybe 2 mbps up/down on a good day. Using D+ renders any other use of the internet unusable.. and frequent pauses for buffering. Not re subsribing until they let you control video qualityIt\\'s not just Disney+, it\\'s a Roku issue. There\\'s multiple apps that have had that issue.I thought it said Mad TV was on Disney +.....now I\\'m sadHow do you find out the amount of internet you\\'ve used/ are using?I had no idea you could do that.Maybe you can figure out a way to cast downloaded video to your TV or Roku? I don\\'t have a Roku, and a quick search didn\\'t look super promising, but I do know that Disney+ limits resolution of downloaded videos.Maybe Disney+ or Roku support will have a solution.Contact Disney support.Use your router to throttle the bandwidth being used by your device. I had to do this a few years ago with Amazon Prime video as it was making us exceed our bandwidth cap every month. AFAIK you can\\'t throttle per provider with most routers but you can put a total throttle on it that should help.Wait you guys have data caps for home WiFi?? the app will stream the max res tat\\'s available for your connection.[removed]You can set your Roku bitrate for all apps like this:https://www.technipages.com/roku-manually-set-connection-speedBasically:* Home 5 times* Rewind 3 times* Fast Forward 2 times.And it takes you to a magic screen where you can set it. For 720p, I would set it to 1.5 or 2 Mbps.Do you have any source for that?  That’s a ridiculous way to do it.I wouldn\\'t have noticed except we\\'ve exceeded our cap, which is only 300gb, every month since we turned the service on.  Once I can say maybe we watched too much youtube or something, twice is suspicious.  I should have actually looked at our data usage before now.  We went from using 190-225 to 350+ each month.Ya, I pick and choose what to watch on my 4K tv because of these STUPID streaming services. As outdated as Amazon’s Prime Video app is in design, at least it lets me choose regular HD or 4K for their originals. I use Disney+ rarely right now and probably won’t keep it because of the forced 4K.What is it with caps over there? Isn\\'t the point of broadband having unlimited internet? If an ISP introduced caps here, they\\'d be laughed out of businessYou stream over 16 hours of video per day? HmmDoes the US have data caps on WiFi?Can you download it to a tablet/phone overnight (or from somewhere else) and then cast/AirPlay it to the TV?Do you know if I stream it from my phone using AirPlay or Chromecast will it work?My router has a traffic function that allows me to see how much data it\\'s processing.  It\\'s not very intuitive since it gives you a total, not per device.  I had to see what was moving while the kids were watching disney+, with nothing else running, to see how much data it was consuming.I just went and got a router that offers a QOS option on a guest network.  It\\'ll let me connect the roku to the guest network and lock the stream to not exceed 5mbps.Some of us do.  The data restrictions are generally unrealistically reached, though. My 300gb cap is pretty uncommon and is something you usually only see with LTE providers.  I don\\'t have any options for hardwired high speed internet where I live.Which is absurd. It should be based on the device resolution.You\\'d have to search this sub for details. Someone used a workaround by setting a limit om their router.It\\'s also kinda ridiculous to use a 4k device with only 720p playback...Be happy. Higher resolution streamed down will look infinitely better than not at all.I feel your frustration, i live in Australia and the internet all over is not great... with that said, things have been a lot worse... hopefully with the introduction of 5G, other plans will become cheaper.Can you get different internet service with a higher cap or no cap?I’m convinced Disney Plus does this on all devices regardless of the setting. Our data has gone through the roof since we got Disney Plus.Honestly, where the hell do you live that has a data cap? thats wildI don\\'t know if that\\'s due to 4k or due to Disney\\'s higher quality stream (which takes more data even when not 4k).Plus, you need to factor in that it\\'s a new service so you might be watching it more than your other services.It is a little bit ridiculous if you ask me. I\\'d complain to Disney and TRY to send them the bill. Not saying it would go anywhere. But I do NOT like the idea of an app being poorly written and costing a paying user extra money for services they do not receive. Especially an app from a company with the pockets of Disney....If they offered it for less co$t per month,  the people not streaming all the time would jump all over itYou do realize that people don\\'t just use data to stream right?  And that households have multiple people who like to stream?Most plans yes. Some have around a 300-500 GB cap. I have a 1TB cap and then some people just have unlimited. It\\'s dumb since someone like one street over can have the option of an incredibly better plan or worse it\\'s literally all based on area and what companies decide to offer what.I take it that’s usually a problem for rural areas?I bought current gen Rokus for $30 that support 4k. There was no point in trying to buy a cheaper model, since the ones I got also had other handy features like the remote with TV power and volume controls.Meanwhile, my TVs are all at least 5 years old and work perfectly fine. None support 4k. No sense in upgrading them when I\\'m happy with how well they work.We have 4 LCD TVs in the house and 3 of them are 10+ years old with 720P/1080i resolution. They all still have good picture quality and have modern 4K streaming devices connected to them because those devices work the best.  We also watch a lot of sports which are generally broadcast in 720P.> It\\'s also kinda ridiculous to use a 4k device with only 720p playback...I can\\'t go buy a new TV every time technology changes.The 4k hardware is often better aside from the resolution. I use a Roku Streaming Stick+ for the better Wi-Fi and an Ultra for Ethernet. Both TVs are 1080p.I have a 1080p TV, and the 4k Fire TV Stick is miles better than the standard variety. It\\'s much faster, and I have the comfort of knowing that when I can afford to upgrade, I don\\'t have to rely on shitty smart TV apps.>It\\'s also kinda ridiculous to use a 4k device with only 720p playback...Mr Nice Guy over here...Right...it\\'ll look better and only be two or three times more expensive in overages.Nope.  Our options are one LTE provider (Rise Broadband) and Hughesnet.  Pisses me off because less than a quarter mile away NTS has fiber...just can\\'t get it here.Not the solution. No reason for any streaming service to force that much data at you if your not outputting to itWhat areas \\\\[of the US\\\\] have a choice of two Internet Service providers?Nah. The internet is already dirt-cheap here. I pay about $15 for a 600Mbps connection with no caps. Slower connections you can get for under 10 bucks. How much cheaper can you make things?Blows my mind. Here in the UK you get unlimited from every provider although speeds are terrible unless you go with virgin media aha.We are in a rural area and pay $120 per month for 300gb.We have one provider and there isn’t even an option to get more we have the max.And while I say rural we are really not that far from large population centres, like 15 minutes to town of 55,000!True...¯\\\\\\\\\\\\_(ツ)\\\\_/¯[removed]There’s 4+ styles of roku devices and the cheapest being non 4K for $30You said in the original post it supports 4K?Can\\'t complain about using old tech with new tech then, I guess... I\\'d sell the roku and downgrade to a first gen chromecast or somethingIt doesn\\'t change that often.I\\'m not suggesting you buy with every new model, but the resolution doesn\\'t change as often as technology changes.We got 720p/1080p HD TVs, after broadcasting hadn\\'t changed for 50+ years (and that was just to add color \\\\[which was compatible with the B&W signal\\\\]) and later on we got 4k mostly just for streaming (but that\\'ll change too).Lol, streaming device apps are really no different from shitty smart TV apps ... Pretty soon you won\\'t be able to up grade to a NEW NON smart TV and if you like Amazon slapping their apps in you face all the time then that\\'s cool , only honest reason I chooses Amazon fire stick because it supports Dolby Vision witch the Roku does not ... I love my LG Oled 4k HDR Dolby Vision with Atmos sound ... There\\'s really no comparison.. but everyone has their own taste in quality entertainmentThis sort of stuff is maddening.  Sorry about that.Fair point. But also these damn providers need to stop capping also.Of course.  I asked only out of curiosity.I live on rural Oregon and we only have satellite internet out here. We\\'re supposed to be getting fiber cable or whatever it\\'s called in the next couple months. Right now we just use our phones hotspot cause its faster.https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov/#/location-summary?version=dec2018&tech=acfosw&speed=25_3This shows what\\'s available for an area though it may have slightly outdated info since they only get updated every year or so.We have *at least* Comcast and Wow here where I\\'m at in the Detroit suburbs, pretty sure we have  AT&T in this neighborhood too (just not in our 4 story condo complex).I\\'ve seen some ads for other companies around here, but I can\\'t be certain they overlap at my place (as the pricing doesn\\'t beat what I have/need, I haven\\'t checked).*Edit:* Plus we have DSL here too.Not counting satellite or cellular, I would venture to guess most urban & suburban areas have at least a couple options (generally a cable provider and a DSL one). Some have a fiber option too although that may be in place of DSL.  Now the choice might not be even (i.e. I can get gigabit cable but only 24Mbps DSL, but I do have both options). There also may be multiple providers over the same infrastructure type (i.e. I have two cable Internet providers). Really, the limits come into play with the more rural areas.Where I am (in Southern California) we only have 2 non satellite options due to monopolies. Where literally a block over they have a third option that I would prefer.Not to brag but my area has a choice of two internet providers, Verizon (DSL) and Spectrum.Certainly can\\'t complain about that!I pay $35 for 100Mbps/10Mbps with no caps and rarely see anyone doing better than that.That said, someone like my mother could do great with 20Mbps down with a 200GB limit for $20 a month (instead of also paying $35 for 100Mbps and having to renegotiate every 2-years).In my area i can either choose comcast and pay them a ton of money for average service or pay at&t a similar price for service so bad even the employees told me not to buy it. Internet companies suck.Every 14 years...lol 4k TVs are only a few hundred.1.  Why should I replace a television that does everything I want it to?2. Doesn\\'t matter how long a 4k television would last, I can\\'t afford the bill to watch tv at that resolution.Disney streams 4k resolution because my connection can handle it and has nothing to do with the TV or streaming device.No I said the **ROKU** supports 4k but is set to 720p and that the TV is 720p.Disney streams 4k resolution because my connection can handle it and has nothing to do with the TV or streaming device.It\\'s a pretty well-documented fact that most smart TV apps aren\\'t updated as regularly, or in some cases at all, when compared to apps for things like Fire TV, Roku and Chromecast. So while functionally they might not be much different at the start of your TV\\'s life, they could be vastly different by a couple of years in.Well...how else are they supposed to increase their profits each year after we stopped paying for cable!?Ann Arbor here. If I don’t want dsl, my only option is Comcast. Consider yourself lucky!Everything I\\'ve read said the bulk of the US is limited to a single provider; but I honestly have no idea.I have two options, COX which can give me close to gigabit cable connection or Frontier which gives me DSL at speeds so low they don\\'t count as broadband.If those are the two choices, I\\'m not sure it\\'s bragging  ;)Are you in the US? Just curious. :)That 10Mbps up is sad. Is it enough for videoconferencing?Doesn\\'t matter where we are in the world all ISP\\'s suck so hard. We have Virgin, BT and basic every mobile/cell brand is an ISP lol. We get like 30-67 mbps for £22 to £31 whilst virgin on a black Friday give 213 mbps for £33 usually £45 which I\\'m guessing is like $60.>Every 14 years...lol 4k TVs are only a few hundred.Maybe it\\'s about not throwing things away that still work great? I mean, I\\'m on a 4K projector, so I don\\'t want to sound holier than thou, but we are living in a pretty ungrateful, disposable society. I\\'m 45, which isn\\'t super old by my estimate [I\\'ll keep saying that], but ya know, we had a TV standard all of my life, plus 25 years before that, until HDTV the early 2000s. Before that decade, people used to actually keep their appliances, including stereos and TVs. Just saying. Is not always about how much money it costs. Sometimes it\\'s more about appreciation of what you have. You literally can\\'t even give most old TVs away now. It\\'s just going in a landfill. This is only a phenomenon starting from this current decade, since they have become so cheap. I\\'m not saying people shouldn\\'t upgrade. I\\'m just saying that your time scale of 14 years being a super long time is a little microscopic in scope.I\\'m using a TV in my kitchen that doesn\\'t even output to 720p. Why? Because I don\\'t really watch TV except if it\\'s for background noise while I\\'m cooking. I stream YouTube vids to it via a Chromecast.If I spent an extra $300 on it, it wouldn\\'t really serve me any better. It would just be throwing away $300. I don\\'t need the HD resolution while I cook... I\\'m not even really looking at the TV.Different strokes.55\" TCL usually goes for around  >$300 quite regularly now.Plus $50/mo for data overages...In reality an older higher quality panel > a cheap 4k panel.  There really is no battle in terms of colour and clarity. Even with a resolution advantage.[deleted]I can\\'t understand why you think that..  it has absolutely everthing to do with your device.Internet here is a \"basic need\". This means that you\\'re not paying for the amount of Internet but for the speed.Yeah, I love my WowWay internet.And it\\'s only $34.99 for 100Mbps/10Mbps with no caps (so far).I get you\\'re being sarcastic, but I am happy with my service. At least there\\'s not a data cap.It’s enough for 1080p and/or screen sharing. Yes, in the US.Can confirm. I do electronic scrap, and the stuff people throw away is just disgusting. Can\\'t believe how much of it still works, and how much is still relatively new. Also printers and Keurig machines are the absolute worst offendersSo he’s saying he doesn’t need the quality and wants lower data usage to save money, and your answer is essentially “if you have to needlessly spend more money on data, you may as well spend more money upgrading your TV that you don’t want to, that way you’re not wasting the extra data. Even though you won’t see the difference. Problem solved.”How is spending more money on a TV in any way an answer to his problem?Yes.I have no idea what you\\'re getting for your money, but I see people complaining about Spectrum all the time and DSL has limits (at least around here it does), so you got the comment (sorry). That doesn\\'t necessarily reflect what you get where you live.I don\\'t have a cap either, though I should check my router or modem to see if I can track that, I really have no idea what I use.With the printers, blame the companies selling cartridges. Replacing a printer because the cartridges went bad, or got used up, with a new printer and its provided cartridges is cheaper than just buying replacement cartridges.  I absolutely don’t condone that, but that’s the economic reality.I’m looking forward to March 24th when I can start participating in these weekly threads properly.I\\'ve been watching the new season of Clone Wars and I love it. I\\'m sad the episodes are so short but everything about them from story to animation is absolutely solid. Some of my favorite Star Wars so far.Disney+? You mean the star wars streaming service right?*The Muppets* (2015-2016) is an absolutely phenomenal show. It\\'s Disney\\'s best Muppet production for sure, but I\\'d venture to say that it\\'s Disney\\'s best production period. Honestly, I think it\\'s one of the best television series of all time.Any recommendations? Really anything, as long as it’s quality.Things I wouldn\\'t normally watch.The Absent Minded Professor, Saving Mr. Banks... Now, because of Saving Mr. Banks, I\\'m halfway through Mary Poppins. I\\'ll watch the second one next. Then, it\\'s up in the air.At the moment, I’m re-watching **High School Musical: The Musical, The Series** for the second time. I happened to remember that this is the “fourth movie” of sorts, saw that the entire first season is up, and watched it all in a night.Here’s why it’s my recommend:* **Homage to the OG trilogy.** I enjoy the covers/mixes done by the new cast as well as the sequences. It’s flattering and a breath of fresh air.* **The new songs are actually fun and charming.** The song **Wondering - Ashlyn & Nini Piano Version** is hands down the best song of the show; one of the characters even says it. Although I will admit that **Born To Be Brave** is a bop.* **Characters are relatable**—to a point. There are some good character arcs although I do wish some characters were developed more. There is hope as the show is renewed for a second season.* **Kourtney is the best character in the show.** She’s the main reason I’m rewatching. The amount of sass she’s got is absolutely lovely and her voice is always an incredible listen.* **The series is a mockumentary.** If *The Office* was set in high school and everyone sings in dramatic fashion, then this is for you. The fact that it’s a mocumentary makes it enjoyable as is.* **It doesn’t take itself so seriously.** There are subtle fourth wall breaks, some lines and jokes have me scream laughing (not many shows can do that with my sense of humor), and the cameos are a lovely addition. Some parts are purposefully cringe-inducing and I like it.My personal scoring is an **8 out of 10**. Most definitely a watch. It’s got a cast that works very well together, the original songs are great, it’s a mockumentary, and I think it can only get better from there.My recommendations are:* **Gravity Falls** \\\\-  I watched it before on **Disney XD** and loved it. It has very clever writing and is very funny. It can be considered \"*dark\"* for some of the stuff that they do, once you watch it you\\'ll understand what I mean.  But yeah, love this show and I wish they would bring it back again (for another season). 🤞* **Lab Rats** \\\\- Also I originally watched this show on **Disney XD**. Same with *\"Gravity Falls\".* As far as the writing, for me personally it is both clever and funny. It\\'s not \"dark\" or anything. The cast is very talented too (besides the writers). Although I will say I wasn\\'t really a fan of the >!\"Bionic Soldiers\" arc !<in Season 4 and their \"spin-off\" **\"Lab Rats: Elite Force\"**. Although I always loved the crossover they did of *\"Mighty Med/Lab Rats\"*; which was in Season 4.  But yeah, highly recommended from me!* **Good Luck Charlie** \\\\- I\\'ll be honest sometimes this show can be weird (in it\\'s premise) I guess. But overall really good show. I did also used to watch this show before it was on \"Disney+\".  Anyway to me personally it\\'s (for all intents and purposes) a \"modern\" take on *\"Full House\"* (especially the 1st Season of *\"Full House\")*. And I also think it\\'s much better in execution than *\"Fuller House\"* on Netflix (just my personal opinion). It\\'s done \"tastefully\" and to me has similar humor to *\"Full House\"* just \"modernized\" that\\'s all. But yeah, really well done!* **Freaky Friday (2003; movie)** \\\\- I always loved this movie and I always thought it was well made and very funny. I never saw the original or anything. But this remake is very good (at least to me)!*Documentaries* I recommend are: * **Waking Sleeping Beauty** \\\\- About the Disney \"Dark Ages\" and how they came out it with the *\"Disney Renaissance\"* in the 80s and the 90s. Very fascinating to see how everything went down during this time and how everything came into being. * **The Imagineering Story (Doc. Series)** \\\\- This was also very fascinating about how \"Imagineers\" came to be and their impact on the Disney Parks (and possibly society)? * **Miracle Landing On the Hudson** \\\\- About Captain Sully and his plane landing on the Hudson River (obviously). I know I keep saying this a lot, but this was also very fascinating. Especially to be able to hear from the *actual* people that were their when it happened.  * **Into The Grand Canyon** \\\\- About two guys that decide to hike and camp along the Grand Canyon for all of the 750 miles (without stopping).  >!But also their doing this to try to make a difference and bring light to the fact that developers are trying to develop the land into something else. and that we all should just leave the land alone and just let nature be...without ruining it. Very well done. Must watch! !<Watching Proud Family and Simpsons at the moment.Would like to see American Dragon: Jake Long on there and hopefully a third season.If I had more time I would watch more but that\\'s life.I cancelled and will start back up again once The Simpson’s is fixed.I’m a huge fan of Tangled and this past weekend finally watched Tangled: Before Ever After which I thought was adorable and a worthy sequel to the original movie, despite it being made-for-TV and with a different animation style. The voice vast, new and returning, is top-notch (love Eden Espinosa and Julie Bowen in their roles). Naturally, I’ve since started watching Tangled: The Series and have genuinely been enjoying it. It does follow the children’s TV show pattern of each episode having a lesson but the storylines are pretty fun and it’s just great to spend time with Rapunzel, Eugene, and a bunch of new characters and old favourites. I’m a big fan of Jeremy Jordan so I’m loving Varian’s episodes. I say all this as an almost-27-year-old woman. Whenever I visit my mom, we continue to work our way through The Mandalorian but have so far only made it to episode 2! Visiting her this weekend so I’m hoping we can knock out a bunch of episodes and maybe even finish them all.I just finished The Simpsons the other day. I\\'m currently midway through season 1 of Gravity Falls. I\\'ve heard nothing but good things about it, but never gave it a shot. So far I\\'m loving it.If ANYONE still hasn’t seen High School Musical: The Musical: The Series, it is now my favorite show ever, with the exception of Doctor Who lol10 Things I Hate About You!!!! Modern take on Shakespeare\\'s taming of the shrew with young Heath Ledger :))))))I’m watching Star vs the Forces of Evil. Fantastic spin on the magical girl genre. It is super funny and heart warming. 95% of the characters are awesome, many fans probably know what character I’m not too keen on. It’s great for all ages and explores some tough subjects in kid friendly waysWatched [The Luck of the Irish](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6qZk9Dnr4kS1Ws2JD1EyxM?si=x5_xiZUlSIGkLpx0XSOAZA) for my podcast\\'s episode on it. It was incredibly nostalgic and a lot of fun but some of the messages I interpreted have not aged so well. Still a lot of fun!Proud family!!!I can’t wait aswell!!!Can’t wait till we get Disney + in UK so I can binge TCW for the first time.I watched some of it when it first aired but with Disney+ I finally watched the whole thing and it really is fantastic.I keep forgetting all of these shows that I only watched a few times that are available on Disney Plus, Oh god i will get to them eventually.Was that the series produced by ABC?I\\'ve been watching: Avengers Earth\\'s Mightiest Heroes and it\\'s amazing!Agent Carter! More insight into Peggy plus an in person Jarvis and Howard growing as a character (plus he\\'s a looker ;) )Oh saving Mr Banks made me cry buckets, but most Disney movies doYou\\'re in for a very nice treat then. :)YesNice! I know what I\\'m watching tonight!!!Sweet!!Xbox One, ps4, android, Apple and different TV\\'sI believe all devices which support d+ in America will be supported.Also Amazon Fire TV.Will Samsung smart TVs have Disney PlusI believe it were LG, Philips and Samsung released after 2018!I like it far better than GotG vol 1&2. Those are the worst in the MCU for me. I have yet to get through either one without falling asleep. Vol 2 especially.Really? I love those ones. Story wise they aren’t great by any means but the characters are fun and the music adds a lot. And Kurt Russel is just hamming it up in the best possible way in vol2.Never watched them lolCan’t stand Pratt or Bautista.Dont like either never haveWhat?! But Bautista has a (an?) hilarious laugh that’s contagious and Pratt is just...Pratt lol. Nooo. That sucks. What about them though don’t you like? Or do you not like the actual actors not the characters?I have never liked Bautista even in the WWE. Just never liked the guy. Pratt just annoys me after awhile.SameInterestingIs this actually a thing happening? LolI thought the french canadians only took up like 1 tiny fraction of the population?What is u doing disney!It makes a lot of sense. Especially after I played moana in spanishIsn’t there already a option that let’s you change the language or the subtitles while you’re watching?Yes grr. I have been periodically searching for a solution for 3 months.They said early 2020 which likely means first quarter. They still have a couple weeks before people can justifiably complainLets hope it’s before the UK launch. Been waiting too long.What do you mean? It was fixed.. it is now stretched out and  you get the whole picture.&#x200B;I think that it was originally cropped? I only watched a minute of it before jumping to season 20.&#x200B;And the first sentence in my post was supposed to be sarcastic but that doesn\\'t play very well on teh internet.Mine fits the whole screen?? I never noticed a problemNarrator: It wasn\\'t.He means putting it in the correct 4:3 ratio that the older seasons were broadcast in. They’re not supposed to fit the whole screen like the more recent seasons, it just looks bad.That\\'s the problem - https://twitter.com/TristanACooper/status/1194298167824650240You may have to do chat or phone call? Might have to do with the price difference of monthly over yearlyYou would probably have to go to your account (https://www.disneyplus.com/account/subscription) cancel your current subscription, and then at the the end of the billing period resubscribe for the annual plan. When you cancel, you will still have access until the end of your billing period which the date is listed on that page.Might be a good question for disney plus via chatThe message explicitly says someone logged into your account at ESPN.com....not Disney Plus. Disney companies have unified usernames. If you create an account at any Disney site, it works on ESPN, ABC, Disney and others. The message is legit. Someone in china got the password for the account. I would respond accordingly.If you need to secure your account just type in the url to the official website.  Even if it looks like a legit email.  This way, nobody has the satisfaction of giving you a bad link.  That being said, it sounds like this may be official email but, better safe than sorry.This isn\\'t phishing, it\\'s legit. I got one a couple of days ago when I signed in on Marvel.com with my Disney account. The Change Password button on that also links to clk.messaging.go.com/somestringofstuff.Also, this email doesn\\'t say you have a Disney+ account, it says that someone logged in with your Disney account on ESPN.com. If you do have a Disney account, I\\'d say change your password by going to any Disney-owned website, just to be safe. If you don\\'t have a Disney account, then someone used your email to create one and you should reclaim and close it.It may not be so.eone from China. They could be using a router device that puts him elsewhere. When im.trying to log into stuff from.work it doesnt even give me the right town it gives me a location like 20 mins awayJust say no it\\'s not you logging into espnThis is NOT from Disney!! I just spoke with a customer service person because I received a similar email. Member.Services@disneyaccount.com does NOT belong to Disney.I recently signed into Disney Store and got basically the same exact email, from the same exact sender. Anytime I log into any Disney accounts it\\'s the same. Disney recently did this to their services to alert people.It\\'s basically the same as Netflix sending an email notifying of a new sign in.Can confirm. Is legit.Hey, I just got the email myself. I suspected it also since my Disney+ is through my wife\\'s email. I don\\'t recall ever making an ESPN account, but I may have years ago. Anyways I was going to email Disney support but before that, I wanted to confirm if I did, in fact, have an ESPN account. I went to ESPN and did a PW recovery and changed my PW at first I only got an ESPN email confirming the change but a minute later received the same email from  [Member.Services@disneyaccount.com](mailto:Member.Services@disneyaccount.com) stating that my ESPN had been accessed by the right source and location.   The Link address is the same as you stated.   I say this email IS legit BUT it is always good practice whenever you get an email like this to go to website directly and change your PW and avoid clicking the email linksThat\\'s probably the best idea, but I have no idea what the official website would be, disneyplus doesn\\'t recognize me, which makes sense since I don\\'t have disney plus, and I don\\'t know what other account they could be talking about.Ah, okay, this makes sense.  I didn\\'t realize ESPN was owned by disney and that an account there is the same as having a \"disney account.\"  I must have created an ESPN account years ago and forgot about it. I changed the password.Hmm.  That\\'s interesting.   [https://www.whois.com/whois/disneyaccount.com](https://www.whois.com/whois/disneyaccount.com) has    Disney Enterprises, Inc. as the organization for the registrant contact for [disneyaccount.com](https://disneyaccount.com).  Maybe [Member.Services](https://Member.Services) is the fake part?  The domain of the link I thought was suspicious is also owned by disney:  [https://www.whois.com/whois/go.com](https://www.whois.com/whois/go.com)   I opened a private mode browser in my secondary browser to follow the link and changed my password to a randomly generated password.  I then logged in to [ESPN.com](https://ESPN.com) using my email and the password that I changed my password to and it seemed to work fine.  In my case all signs point to this being legitimate, even though it freaked me out at first since I didn\\'t realize [ESPN.com](https://ESPN.com) logins were \"disney account\" logins.This is a legitimate email address from [Disney.com](https://Disney.com). But it is not from Disney+. That customer service agent is giving out inaccurate information.I also spoke to customer service who states that they do own that addresshttps://imgur.com/EaAUu2nI just spoke with Disney in a chat...they said disregard and do not click!!!You should reset your password using the email address you signed up with. https://help.disneyplus.com/csp?id=csp_indexGo down to manage my accountNo problem. Pretty sure this unified \"Disney Account\" thing is fairly recent as my Disney and Marvel.com accounts had different passwords and were separate accounts and up until a few months ago. Same thing could\\'ve happened with ESPN.Why did my customer service person say it didn’t belong to them Do you have a screenshot of the washed out colours? I have a Chromecast too but so far, I’m not seeing any changes in the colours.Same here! Very strange.Yes. Same here. Something definitely happened. I\\'m currently using the built in app on my Vizio because it has dolby vision and it\\'s looking much better than Chromecast since a few days ago.Wonder if ur chromecast is having issues?i\\'m having the same issue. any update on this?Seeing this as well. Especially noticeable in animated movies like Frozen and Toy StoryIt\\'s casting fine with all other apps, so I\\'m guessing it\\'s not the Chromecast. Even Disney Plus looks fine when browsing titles, but when fades colours when playing a showTo add to this. It seems to only affect either my Samsung TV -or- Chromecast Ultra. I have a Sony TV with a non-ultra and the colors are fine.It could also be the HDR streaming vs 1080p (the Samsung is 4k, the Sony is 1080p)To finish this up...I switched the two Chromecasts between TVs and colors were fine in both, making me think HDR titles. Then I switched back and the colors were fine again with the ultra on the 4k TV. So I\\'m guessing the re-plug fixed the issue for me personally.I swear if I don\\'t see 4 dozen eggs being eaten...But why?we don\\'t need a prequel treatment to everything.The boy refused to help an old lady, who was a witch, that placed the cursed on him. End of story...how can they make a prequel series out of that sentence?I didn’t really accept Luke Evans as Gaston, but without Belle and/or the Beast, I could foresee this being just a buddy comedy that lets me forget that either character is connected to the original narrative at all.I\\'ll go out on a limb and say the people reacting negatively to this aren\\'t the target audience of the remake or this prequel. I\\'m sure it\\'ll be funny enough (especially with Gad), but nothing groundbreaking. Gotta fill up that steaming service library!No thanksI would rather see a prequel about all the poon lumiere was getting before he was a candle.LolwutWhat prequel? Beast was a dick kid, Belle was a lonely child, Gaston was still a beloved prick and I guess a war hero? Lumiere is a horny butler and Cogsworth is a crotchety chamberlain.WE KNOW THEIR ORIGINS. Their story was already told.With [Ron Perlman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beast_(1987_TV_series))?It\\'s by the same guys who did OUAT which is .......a good thing because we know it\\'s gonna be cheesy as all hell? Seeing that Josh Gad has worked on it is interesting too. I liked Gaston and LeFou in the live action, so I\\'ll definitely watch this.I am totally okay with this as long as they go full Breaking Bad with it. I know they won\\'t. That\\'d just be really, really funny.I must be the only one looking forward to this. These characters were the main thing I enjoyed in the remake and I\\'m all for more musicals.I’m good thanksI’ve never seen a better use for meh.While I\\'m confident that both Evans and Gad will provide strong material for the creators to work with, this is everything I feared from Disney +.But hey, at least we\\'re getting Marvel and Star Wars shows, right?Of all the prequels they could do...this one sounded like a good idea? They could have redone treasure planet as live action, could have gotten another Star Wars: \\'literally any part of the franchise to print money\\', Aladdin prequel with genie and other master\\'s, sword and the stone, and a lot of others.This is just gaston and LeFou dicking about for however many episodes? How the hell did they pitch this?!Remember when Disney had new ideas:/Adam (Draco Malfoy voice): \"I don\\'t care what she wants, send her away!\"*In a world where Prince Adam had everything he could ever want*Adam: \"Wait until my father hears about this!\"*His kingdom lives in fear*Mrs. Potts, tearfully: \"Yes, Master Adam.\" (she and Chip scurry away, they\\'re both crying)*But this summer...*Old beggar woman: \"Will you give this old woman a warm bed for the night?\" (she smiles sinisterly)*He\\'s about to get...*\"Go away, you old hag! Before you stink up the place.\" (the old woman lands on the snow)*A \\\\*beastly\\\\* lesson*(Adam\\'s POV, we see furry hands) \"Wha-wha... what\\'s happened to my hands?\" (A roar goes out)*From the writers of Game of Thrones*Adam: \"No! I refuse to live as a beast! I dun want eht!\"*And the director of Paul Blart: Mall Cop*Old woman: \"You will be forced to live out this curse until you learn to truly love.\"(Another roar)*Disney\\'s... Rise of the Beast*Why[deleted]Finally we\\'ll learn how he turned to the dark side.i thought they couldn\\'t top the Aladdin show announcement.why?If it ain\\'t broke, don\\'t remake itHonestly if it stays a minisieries and doesn\\'t try to take itself too seriously, I could get behind this.No.I would love it if it was like, a parallel universe take. Like, let it go where it wants to without having to end up at the movie.Is it known who does the music? Menken or Lin?NOOOO just leave a good thing alone, this is last live action remake I was excited about. I don\\'t want anymore and am done with it. Make something new instead.tbh I\\'ll take more Luke Evans no matter how I can get itWhyGaston did nothing wrong.I will watch this for no other reason than Luke Evans.Not a prequel... A sequel, where Bell now turns into the beast.Why do they need to piggy back on things they already did. Create something NEW. Has their been any original content that’s not tied to a property yet???... what?Why? Please stop. No one will get their D+ sub for this.Disney: We made dvd animated sequels, Remakes, what else can we do? PREQUELS.Gonna call my bet now, it\\'s gonna bomb.• \\'There isn\\'t any content on Disney+\\' • Disney+ announces prequel show• \\'No, not that\\'Isn\\'t this what Disney+ is created for? To have a space to create original content for their IP\\'s?So much useless crapno.And it better show the transition to 5 dozenThis!!! Soo much thisBecause no oneeeee acts like Gaston, brings profits like Gaston, unnecessarily creates canon like Gaston....Edit: first silvers ever thx guys$Male models.Because people can\\'t stop themselves from paying for them.Have self control. Stop going to see Disney remakes in theaters.Disney.But I want to know more about the dirt the Rose came fromThe article says that it’s Gaston and LeFou getting an origin story, not the prince/beast. So it’d be war centered, because that’s how they met & became friends I believe. Could be interesting, I’m all for Disney trying new things with IP rather than just rebooting it.I feel the sameThat’s exactly what’s happening. They’re just creating things that will get hits from newer Disney fans on Disney+. They’re trying to fill their catalog with originals even if they’re just cash grabs.I mean the only reason I would watch is if dan stevens was in it because I love dan stevensHahaha I\\'m dying to know his story and cogsworth🎶Tale as old as time...🎶It\\'s not about themIts Gaston\\'s movieI understood that reference.OUAT became such a damn mess as time went on but I think the limited series format could be good for this. Adam and Eddy need that reining in.Lmao!!No no, we\\'re two!I\\'m Intrigued so 2 and half? HahaOr pass HahaMore mando!!Upvoting for Treasure Planet. I watched that for the first time when I got Disney+, and it is absolutely in my top 10 favorite Disney animated movies.I\\'m curious about the pitch tooActually Disney relied on the public domain to create movies he just created mickey and pals as a studio mascot so even when it started it relied on old stuffNot even Pepperidge Farm remembersWhen hahaSameSame can be said for Netflix movies too.Gotta admit I\\'ve always wondered tooIts supposed to be Gaston\\'s story?Not a bad ideaLmao so.far I think I\\'ve only see a couple.ppl say thisHahaIts Gaston\\'s movie100How does something bomb on a streaming service? They already have your subscription money.Lol right?How else are we supposed to see him get roughly the size of a barge?Sell out /sMale models?> Have self control. Stop going to see Disney remakes in theaters.Except this is coming to Disney+ so what\\'s the advice here? Stop subscribing to subscription services?Hahah kinda trueDi$ney.Fixed it for ya, buddy.You seedists. Never care about the seeds.They tried that with Maleficent with \\'mixed\\' results.I\\'m curiousBasicallyIt’s around Gaston not beast or belleYou could even go as far to look at Hollywood’s history. Plenty of films are just retelling of already made books and fairytales.Not just the public domain.Plenty of the early Disney movies are licensed from books still under copyright.In some cases (_Dumbo_, _Lady and the Tramp_) they were licensing manuscripts before they were printed (studios still do the same today).>he just created mickeyLet me introduce you to [Ub Iwerks](https://www.cartoonbrew.com/disney/5-reasons-why-mickey-mouse-co-creator-ub-iwerks-is-awesome-81999.html) among other things Mickey\\'s co-creator.the shows are basically given their own time to shine on the service.the precense of the show should increase subscribers or make the users more active.if it doesn\\'t do that it\\'s considered a bomb,Hahaha 100 dyingDisney will have the #s on how often this is watched and by what percentage of subscribers. Also they\\'ll see if there is a spike for new subscriptions around it\\'s launch. That\\'s the data they\\'re looking for when it comes to streaming. So if you\\'re adamant about not supporting this, then be sure to never watch it when it launches. That said, I\\'m totally gonna watch it.Haha that will never happenLmaoHa. Thanks!You fertilists. Never care about the fertilizer.Yeah, Maleficent 2 was terrible. The idea was there, but no story. That said, I didn’t like Maleficent 1 to begin with, they took the Disney villain I feared the most and turned her nice. Still I’d watch a buddy buddy war flick with Gaston growing into the man he became in BatB. It’s not like going to the cinema costs me much, nor D+, so I’d probably just watch it anyway.Interesting. I\\'m not sure about that story tho but I\\'m intriguedYou florists. Never care about the flora.I feel like if it was something like the beginning of the 3rd Indiana Jones movie I could see myself liking it.Be wartime so could be weirdYou oxygenists. Never care about the oxygen.Right?Shame Three Men and a Bride never happened. Not like Steve Gutenberg has anything better to do.YuckThey should cast Rudd, Downey and Hemsword for the roles.Surprised it’s not gender flipped tbh lol. RDJ would be a shoe in for the Selleck role assuming they keep it similar to the original. MBJ for the struggling actor part and Paul Rudd for the Gutenberg partLmaoThat would be interesting\\\\I\\'m having a similar problem on Chrome. I can see the Disney logo in the top left corner, and all of the various categories to the right. But the main page is completely blank and nothing will load on it. The login circle is completely grey and it won\\'t let me open it.  I\\'ve tried resetting my internet and restarting my PC and nothing has fixed it. I haven\\'t tried switching browsers.Do you have some sort of adblocker enabled?

Thanks.That was it!  Thank you!This worked! Thank you so muchI managed to get it to work on Internet Explorer. I watched two episodes of the Clone Wars without issue. I still can’t get Chrome to work.I don\\'t think so because it\\'s on your device (phone or tablet) and you\\'re just screening it to another screen.Nope, it doesn\\'tI have it as an app on my LG 4k TV in Canada.There is an extensive FAQ about what devices are supported:https://help.disneyplus.com/csp?id=csp_article_content&sys_kb_id=fcc1b1921bcb0818202bb8061a4bcb5aFor LG this is what is stated:“Disney+ supports LG TVs from 2016 or later with WebOS 3.0 and up.”same, I\\'m in the UK and waiting for this app to launch on the LG content store, dunno whether to get Disney + while its on offer in anticipation for the app.We didn\\'t get the app for Vizio for months after Disney+ was launched in the US.Does anyone in the UK have this app yet?No app here on my 2019 LG TV (UK)Everyone I know has appExcellent thank you, as I guessed they probably want release the app here until close to launch.Me too. Hoping my B6 gets it. It’s on the US list but🤷\\u200d♂\\u200dI just checked on my lg tv and it\\'s not showing up yet. My tv is a smart 4k set from 2016 with webos 3.5. Hope this info helpsNot on my B6. Going to check on Tuesday. 👍Worked this morning. LG B6. Streaming well.I\\'ve got it on mine and my tv is 3 years older. (UK) Only became available today.No worries at all, if I remember correctly, the app launched on launch day.  Was buggy at first, but seems pretty ironed out now.Yeah same here it went live at 1am this morningAre you finding that it works? I can move around the main menu but as soon as I try to scroll anywhere on the Simpsons the app is totally non-functional.Yeah it\\'s a little slow and glitchy but I\\'m sure that\\'ll be sorted quickly.[According to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney%2B#Launch), mid-2020.It’s supposed to come to the Nordic countries this summer, no specific date has been announced.This Summeroften its up to Nordic Entertainment Group for us in sweden etc they have viaplay etc i supouse there will be a deal with viaplay or viasat becouase they will still have the orginal disney channelsHope it hits you guys soonLaunching on March 24th (in UK&Ireland, France, Italy, Spain, Germany, Austria and Switzerland and summer 2020 for Portugal, Nordics, Poland and Belgium), subscribers will be able to access the best stories in the world, all in one place, including blockbuster movies like “Avengers: Endgame,” and Oscar-winning documentaries such as “Free Solo.” Along with classic Disney series like “Hannah Montana” and original shorts including “Forky Asks a Question,” Disney+ is the go-to entertainment destination for the entire family.Source https://thewaltdisneycompany.eu/disney-announces-full-content-line-up-2Yep it’s available on Xbox one :)Good luckJust get a US XBL account and you’ll be able to download the app now :)Great - Hopefully the app will be available in the UK soon then.You\\'re worrying me now!If it\\'s like the US, you won\\'t be able to download the app until launch day.All I know from reading is the app can be glitchy at launch so that\\'s why I say good luck. Nothing badAnd how is the app?It was great a few months ago in the Netherlands! Haven\\'t used after the beta!It’s great! Works perfectly!I don\\'t know. I don\\'t own an XBox.How do you know the exact video resolution?  Developer tools?Weird. Wonder if disney isnt strong in ur area?Yep. I have Xcode on my iMac and it displays the resolution.  But even without it, my eyes can see if it’s 1080p or 480p. It’s all pixels.Some apps will show you. My Vizio apps easily show the current resolution.It’s pretty weird... All the other streaming services work in 2160p within seconds, but not Disney+.I\\'ve read of few other people having trouble with Disney+.  Most have no problems.  All I can figure is that your region\\'s servers are overloaded.apps on apple tv do not unless you enable some developer debugging.  that\\'s why I ask.I understand that some apps will not show you, that\\'s why I said: \"*some* apps will show you\".To clarify, it\\'s not the app that I see telling me, but the info bar on my TV tells you resolution, video (HDR, DV, etc.), audio (stereo, etc.); it tells you that for hardware connected or local app streaming information.Do you have an ad blocker on your network or device? I started having the same issues today until I disabled my ad blocker. Disney made some change that caused this incompatibility.I see a new  **js-agent newrelic** item being blocked that I didn\\'t see yesterday. I think it is some analytical part.I was getting the same network error on my Android device, and then disabled my Private DNS settings (had been using adguard) and it loaded right up. Hope that solves it for you as well!Thanks whoever said to disable the Private DNS settings. I can\\'t reply to you exactly cuz the comments aren\\'t loading for me for some reason.Have had this all day on my Galaxy Note 10 Plus. Deleted app and cleared data and everything. My Firestick and TV are fine. Just showing this on my phone todayIm getting this now too. It used to work on MiBox S but now i get the same error and have to cast from iPad.Cute, I get the Wreck It Ralph characters and a. \"No Internet Connection\" error message.&#x200B;Roku Ultra - Only Disney Plus app not working. Happily streaming Netflix and Plex.I have similar issue on PC and Android TV. Error 42 is shown on the latter. Works the day before. Let me know if you\\'ve managed to find a solution?[removed]EwwwYeah I had to disable Private DNS and now it works!So you\\'re telling me I have to enable ads on my device if I want to use the app? That sucks.Same issue and this worked for me.However am I just screwed on using advised now? I don\\'t want to disable that across the board.Disable Private DNSDo you have some sort of private DNS. If so then try turning it offI turned off Private DNS/Adblock so if you have that then might want to try thatManaged to identify the problem after some intensive log reading. Playback works again after I whitelisted the *.edge.bamgrid.com domain. Hope this helps the others :)I didn\\'t know there was a 3rd sandlot movieOriginal is lifeI didn\\'t know there was two!This is getting out of hand, now there are two of them!They can\\'t compete with the original.That\\'s for sureImagine this in 4k. Or avatar...I was in the coast gaurd. i was kicked out when i messed up my back in a training exerise. i was training to be a rescue swimmer. jump from the helicopters and help people. i never got to make a jump. Never been able to bring myself to watch this movie either. just always hurt to try.Didn\\'t realize they look it off. There alot of things disney took off ?I\\'ve never heard of this movie, recommended?A beautiful film, i love itIt’s weird when a movie gets pulled from another streaming service and Disney makes a big deal of it coming back like they have been with Black Panther...like, almost everyone who has D+ has Netflix and had access to watch this movie there for a year.Lmao! Disney could not upload a real photo of the movie? They just used a screenshot from a phone, lmao!Yay?Awesome!If it\\'s like The sandlot it\\'ll only be back for one month same thing for Alice in wonderland looking GlassNever heard of.thisHold up. They don\\'t have Avatat in 4K? Did it get a 4K release?They can\\'t celebrate putting new stuff on every month, if they don\\'t take stuff off. /SYeah, they take off a few things every month, but they try and keep it a secret for some reason.Some things come back, some don\\'t, but when a movie comes back they treat it like a new release and advertise it all over again.I watched it when Disney+ first came out.  I liked it.  It\\'s a solid B.Yeah it was a lot better than I expected6.7 on IMDb, 63% on Rotten Tomatoes. I’d say it’s a pretty good movie even though I’ve never actually seen it.I really really enjoyed itAnd yet, I cancelled Netflix almost a year ago and watched Black Panther over the past couple days.From what I’ve seen from a quick google search it looks like it hasn’t been released yet? I don’t know how accurate the sites I found are but I also didn’t see it pop up on amazon. The only 4k avatar I COULD find was Avatar: The Last Airbender.Jim Cameron\\'s Avatar was shot digitally as 2K stereoscopic 3D , so a 4K/UHD version would be an up-convert, but you would possibly get HDR and WCG (P3) Wide Color Gamut.But what about The Abyss which has been remastered for UHD Bluray.https://www.slashfilm.com/the-abyss-blu-ray/Have you ever seen The Guardian? How would you say it compares to that?Very surprised anyone would cancel Netflix with the amount of new content they offer almost daily for D+ unless you have kids or are just a Disney fanatic.Avatar the Last airbender is the best! Must watch.Its probably the live action one.... since its 4k....I hope your talking about the cartoon by Nickelodeon because the live action film was an abomination from start to finish.There is no live action one 😉 (it’s so bad)👍🏻 agreed I’m just hoping the upcoming Netflix version is like the cartoon and nothing like the movie. It’s literally my favorite tv show even as an adult and I’ve got it on DVD and HD iTunes because I love it so much.I think Netflix will do a good job adapting the cartoon into live action since the producers will make sure its not whitewashed unlike the movie that came out years ago plus Netflix has been doing a good job adapting the Witcher series that is based on the books/games that makes me think they will do the show justice.I’m optimistic too. But children acting adds a variable.There are 2 main reasons why Fox content is not on Disney Plus.1. The content is too mature.2. There is a current contract for another service. Once the contract expires, it\\'ll be on Disney Plus.Why do you need this help and why do you need 20 people?Which fox content? Fox has a lot of mature stuffBut also a lot of content suitable for the service z Alita Battle Angel, Bob\\'s Burgers... Even ABC content like Blackish with its spinoffs...any fox content for nowBob\\'s burgers, king of the hill, futurama is all on hulu.I think it\\'s a better fit but when Disney Plus airs the movie \"10 things I hate about you\" where a high school staff member is on screen writing erotica. Well safe to say I dom\\'t know why Disney will censor their own cartoons like gravity falls or licensed preschooler show like Bluey.Yes they announced  that they will add itThis has already been discussed heavily.Disney will knowWould they even add this?I think it’s one of those shows they put on HuluWhereIt\\'s a Fox-owned family sitcom that a lot of people fondly remember.

ThisNever heard of.dog with blog. When was this2012-2015This is a known issue. Either Disney will start a French language course - free, for Canadians - or they will actually fix it. See other posts for updates.This glitch has been happening a lot for a lot of peopleMine acts up..in chicagoCheck that you are using English subtitles?this is due to the app in the canadian region deciding to only load the french video file to D+, the one work around that works is to change your region to the USA.If only the Canadian school system would teach us French for free.Darn, I really hope they get it fixed soon!Yep, checked all that. Set everything to English on both my iPhone and laptop. Doesn’t make any sense ehSorry for taking my story from sc, but earlier today I tried downloading the Star Wars clone wars series and these 2 episodes refuse to download for whatever reason. Each time I check on the information icon, I get a message saying that I must connect to the internet to renew my license while I’m obviously connected to the internet, or the other episodes shouldn’t have been able to continue downloading.Have you downloaded them again? Maybe too many episodes? Maybe these episodes cannot be downloaded.REinstall.and try again work?The thing is at first this message was displayed to all of the episodes except season 7 and some of season 6, so I know they can be downloaded. I suppose o could delete the app again and download everything again. I’ll leave a response on if that fixes it.Yes, it did work. My apologies for the late update but I was out of the country and unable to access the platform at the time. It’s just a bit of a bother to do that and a potential strain on your data plan.I’ve also been experiencing this issue and have been using the same work around. At least now I know someone hasn’t been messing with me and my log in info is likely not compromised.My simpsons has been doing this tooYeah, this was my first thought (that some dutch dude had hacked my account and was getting free Disney, which i wouldn\\'t mind if he was willing to leave my language controls alone). I\\'m going to flag this to Disney today and see what happens. And yes.. i know... i have done the ol\\' ask reddit first rather than go through the actual support channels. If I get an answer, I\\'ll update it here.Hahaha I thought the same for a whileLeave my english language!!!Maybe uninstall and reinstallNo Find Me in Paris? So weird considering it\\'s a Disney Channel show (everywhere but the USA and UK, where it\\'s in Hulu and Nick)I love bonkers!!! TalespinOh you guys I feel bad for uInteresting, thank you for posting!At first sight, Disney+ France will have the same shortcomings as Disney+ in the Netherlands:- a VERY minimal selection of classic shorts (why Disney, WHY?)- No TaleSpin- No Bonkers- No Hercules series- No Emperor’s New SchoolVery disappointing!Still, there are more classic shorts than in the Netherlands; plus The Rescuers and the Doug series will be a available. So France is better off than the Netherlands at least.It remains utterly frustrating and completely incomprehensible that the classic shorts and other old content as listed above is NOT made available in all markets. We know that there are NO existing contracts for this material and that it is not being broadcast or streamed anywhere else. Also, this is the content that many Disney fans have been waiting for, as it has been largely unavailable for years.It is extremely disappointing to see Disney making this available in a few markets only.Who knows, other movies that were taken off at the same time or after it, have returned already (and some even vanished again already, after less than a month back) this one is a more notable missing title for the fact that Disney+ had it in 4K Dolby vision, which is not available anywhere elseDang I didnt know they took it offI watched them. Before they pulled.it I guessSaaaaaadI think I read somewhere that it’s on Cinemax? But I’m not sure if that’s entirely correct. I’m sure it’s tied up somewhere though.But eventually it should get to Disney+ since it’s a 20th Century Fox film and it’s rated PG. Not sure when that will be though.I think all the stuff depends on license and contractsThis and Me and Earl and the Dying Girl better go on it some time. Fox Searchlight has a lot of great stuff that\\'s being missed out on.Strange, they deleted it; here’s a [list](https://www.cordbusters.co.uk/disney-plus-launch-lineup-full-list/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) anywayWell, that list is surprisingly impressive. Especially the Marvel movies. I guess the new Sky deal worked something out with Now TV.Frozen 2So we may see it in March4K hdr?No 90s X-Men or Spidey TAS/Spectacular? :(Tweet is unavailableJust as an aside, has anyone with a LG TV in the UK managed to find the Disney+ app yet? I checked last night and nothing...\"Will The Simpsons be there? Will we find Nemo? What happens to The Vault? All your questions answered – check out everything that’s coming to #DisneyPlus in the UK.

Love to see it. Also, I think it’s time to start binging Simpsons> 3.12. Star Wars SpecialsWas I the only one disappointed there was no Holiday Special there?Come on Disney release it you cowards!It\\'s a bit weird that it only has the second Diary Of A Wimpy Kid movie.no Bluey for the little ones :( hopefully its added at some point!That’s crazy. Content wise. Definitely subscribing now lmao.Got them all except Spider-man right? Assuming Sony relatedNo, the list is terrible. We don\\'t even get all the shows the US gets:TalespinHerculesEmperor\\'s New SchoolBonkersThe ReplacementsProud FamilyBlueyNone of these shows will be on for the UK.I mean that\\'s pretty shoddy, since Proud Family is getting a continuation.90s X-Men and Spider-Man TAS are there, no spectacular thoughI think I read Marvel shows still to come later, maybe not from releaseYeah they deleted I posted a link in comments / they re tweeted itUK apps confirmed to drop at launch I’m sure!Apps usually drop at launch Be prepared for some bugs and kinks at firstRecess!!!!We\\'re getting Recess, but not even the US gets Lloyd in Space.Yes we did. We only get 16/22 released Disney cartoon series from 80s-early 2000s. all of these are missing:TalespinHerculesEmperor\\'s New SchoolBonkersThe ReplacementsProud FamilyThe worst part is, they won\\'t even give a release date for shows, only Movies.Yeah I’m definitely doing the £50 for a yearAnd Hulk due to Universal.We also have some films that the U.S. version currently doesn\\'t. Personally, I don\\'t care about a handful of either old cartoons or shows I\\'ve never heard of. You may be ready to tell me how I\\'m objectively wrong and should be angry, but all I cared about was The Simpsons and as many modern films (especially the MCU) as possible. We got those when it looked like we wouldn\\'t, so, it\\'s impressive to me. If it\\'s not to you, cool. I don\\'t care.I found X-Men but what is Spider-Man TAS listed as?Oh thanks must\\'ve missed itNever heard of any of them bar ENSWhich Movies don\\'t the US get, but we do?New Spider-Man or Spider Man (1994)Hercules used to air a lot. Surprised you never heard of Proud Family though.One big one that I\\'m pretty sure of is Incredibles 2. There\\'s others too but that was a standout.I’m in the UK if that explains it? Also Im 21 lolwhy do muppets never make the subtitle?Bad list. Just screams \"Americans only, fool\".I love the cartoon muppetsWe’ve always known this.Isn’t that the usual standard for shows?How about season 2 in Canada?Meanwhile, let’s keep naggin’ ‘em to fix the episode order of Season 1! 😁They appear to be doing these delays in Australia and NZ too, but Disney shut down the Disney Channel here when they launched D+. I feel like Disney Channel shows should go straight to D+ here without delay since there’s no other legitimate way to watch this content.This seems like a dumb idea I mean really they\\'re competing with torrents more than anything and I doubt people are going to wait until the episode comes out on Disney Plus.Noooooooooo!Why do we need a ducktales rebootIt\\'s on Disney Now once an episode airs. That\\'s how I\\'ve watched the show.> these delaysNot a \"delay\", as this is standard practice. Most TV shows don\\'t show up streaming until right before the next season airs, and they certainly don\\'t show up *while* the season is airing.Because it\\'s actually good, the reboot has been airing since 2017.Yeah that\\'s different. Disney Now isn\\'t a subscription streaming service, it\\'s an extension of your cable subscription. You need to have the Disney Channel to watch new stuff on DisneyNow, so that\\'s why they get it early.Disney+ and Disney Now are two different things though.But the season doesn’t “air” here as the channel no longer exists. So they should add it to D+ here the same time that it airs on the Disney Channel in the US. If that means new episodes week-by-week like they do for D+ originals, so be it.Early? They don’t get it before it’s aired on TV.Disney channel is where it airs. Streaming gets it later. Just like every other tv show that starts on tvEarly compared to Disney+That\\'s actually not true they do. 2 a.m. Central Time every day Disney adds new episodes that will air later that dayYou\\'re missing my point, so I\\'m going to elaborate.The reason content (like Ducktales Season 3) doesn\\'t go straight to streaming services in the US is because Disney would rather you pay to consume it via some other channel first. In the case of movies, Disney would obviously prefer you go to the theater to watch, and/or buy it on Blu-Ray or digital before they finally allow you to stream it on D+. With TV shows, Disney would prefer that you remain subscribed to the Disney Channel as well D+, so it goes there first before finally heading to D+.In Australia and New Zealand there \\\\*is\\\\* no Disney Channel since Disney made the decision to shut it down when they launched D+. So there is \\\\*no other way\\\\* to pay to watch that content. You can\\'t buy it on digital, you can\\'t watch it on any other pay TV service, so as a fan you have this frustrating period where you simply can’t watch it anywhere even though you know it exists. Disney would lose nothing by adding it to D+ at the same time that each episode airs in the US, but it would mean a lot to their fans and it keeps people happy and engaged.There are precedents for this. For example, ABC (which Disney owns) doesn\\'t exist here as a TV channel, but their content such as The Goldbergs is made available to stream on local platforms as it airs in the USA (or very close to it). Again, Disney lose nothing as there\\'s no alternative monetary way to view this content. Similarly, other US media companies add their content to Netflix here, such as CBS and their newer Star Trek series. We don\\'t have CBS here, so we get it on Netflix as it airs in the US.Hope this makes sense. If not: consider this scenario. Imagine Disney shut down the Disney Channel in the USA, but you had to wait for content to air on the Disney Channel UK before it was added to Disney+ in the USA. It would be pretty annoying right? Same scenario here.I agree with this 110%. It’s the logical next step. They already sort of did this with 101 Dalmatian Street (the first season aired exclusively in the UK. They “premiered” the entire thing on Disney+ for American and Canadian audiences. Iirc this is also true of the Legend of the Three Caballeros). Disney has had years to take notes from and improve upon Netflix. Since Disney Channel no longer exists in Australia and they want to discourage piracy, one would think Disney would be willing to air their properties (especially something like DuckTales which has a huge following compared to a lot of their other TV offerings) on Disney+ for people to watch. Even if there was a week’s gap between its initial airing and putting the episode on Australian Disney+, it’s better than radio silence for an entire season. I adore Disney but their handling of Disney+ is pretty lackadaisical so far.Sandlot 2 should never be seen anywhere ever again.So the original is gone again?Sandlot: heading Home is also available now. I tried posting but it never showed up.The what?  Huh. Missed this one ever being made.Ewwww original is lifeYep!Thank you, u/stitchkingdom.Nice, thanks for the update!Must be niceYou missed nothingPeople say the same thing when I talk about “Leprechaun Back In The Hood.”Is there somewhere we can see a bigger list?Surprised at how many Simpsons episodes we get! All but the latest season it seems!You can see [the full list here](https://www.cordbusters.co.uk/disney-plus-launch-lineup-full-list/). The fact that The Mandalorian is still getting weekly releases at this point in time is just silly...Notable details:  \\\\#1. The Simpsons Season 31 will be available to stream in November (at least in the UK)  \\\\#2. Selected Nat Geo content WILL be available on launch (including Free Solo)  \\\\#3. Home Alone 1 & 2, POTC: On Stranger Tides, and Garfield: A Tale of Two Kitties (which are not currently available to stream in the US) will be available on launch - this also confirms that 20th Century titles will be on the platform in the UKLooks like the UK will get a bigger set of classic animated shorts than the lousy 10 the Netherlands got.Still, the overall package seems to be less complete than the US version. No Bonkers, no TaleSpin.Wish x men evolution and wolverine and the x men was on there but hopefully will be added soon with some fantastic four moviesI wasn’t really excited for The Simpson’s, but 600 episodes is pretty awesome. Not really bothered about the Fox stuff - I mean yeah it’s great but Garfield isn’t really a deal breaker. Still hoping they change their mind about The Mandolorian, but for me it’s the MCU stuff, especially Agents of Shield etc. Hoping they have a few more surprises...Yay! All 5 Pirates of the Caribbeans at launch!! So excited!Looking at the complete list, the amount of MCU movies is a pleasant surprise considering the Now TV exclusivity fears.NO BLUEY!? My little girl is not going to be happy!I’m really surprised we’re getting the lion king considering it’s coming to sky cinema next FridayMando is gonna be weekly? Why?unfortunately this is all that I could find! (unless disney+\\'s UK social media handles post a massive thread of launch titles like in the US)https://www.cordbusters.co.uk/disney-plus-launch-lineup-full-list/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmfI thought Disney confirmed that wasn\\'t the caseit’s most likely stop people from just binging through that and keep them subscribedWe don\\'t even get these 6 cartoons:TalespinHerculesEmperor\\'s New SchoolBonkersThe ReplacementsProud Family&#x200B;We only get 16 classic cartoons total. :/Also, not all of the Disney cartoons on the US D+ will be on the UK version:TalespinHerculesEmperor\\'s New SchoolBonkersThe ReplacementsProud Family&#x200B;None of these will be on.No tailspin!? How random, it\\'s not like it airs anywhere in the UK that I know of. I\\'d love to know the reason, I\\'m sure they wouldn\\'t do it if they didn\\'t have one. Either that or its just got left out accidentally.Yeah, they cut a lot of TV shows. :/What is blueyYeah, they cut a lot of TV shows. :/It feels like they\\'re keeping it vague on purpose. While a \"Chat Support\" rep confirmed it, Disney never confirmed it officially, and in fact their [Tweets about it](https://twitter.com/DisneyPlusUK/status/1229354731916709888) imply that it WILL be a weekly roll-out (\"#TheMandalorian episodes will start to roll out from March 24th\")I don\\'t think Disney is thinking people will watch one show and then leave....I have been trying to find out the reason since November. The only thing that I have learned is that these things are apparently decided in Disney’s main office in Burbank and that the local staff knows nothing about it.I thought that there might be a problem with the Dutch dub or subtitles, but not seeing it on the UK list makes me think there is another reason (dubbing or subtitling would be unnecessary for the UK of course)!It also looks like some classic Disney shows like Mickey Mouse Club and Adventures of Spin and Marty are missing from the UK list. They were released in the US; very curious if the UK will get them after all! We didn’t get them; I thought because Disney does not want to make the effort to subtitle them. But if they are missing for the UK as well there may be a different reason.All in all, very disappointing.It\\'s a surprisingly brilliant Disney junior show that my daughter adores. I noticed it was on the US Disney+ so I was excited to be able to put it on without ads. But unfortunately it seems missing from the UK version.If you have young kids I can\\'t recommend the show enough.Mickey Mouse Clubhouse is in the UK version.Along with Talespin, we also won\\'t get: Hercules, Emperor\\'s New School, Bonkers, The Replacements, Proud Family.I meant the original 1955 Mickey Mouse Club, not Mickey Mouse Clubhouse ;-) It is available in the US (only the 5 episodes that were released earlier on DVD, but still). We have 2 seasons of Proud Family now, but only since a month or so. Maybe UK will get it later?Maybe, but I do wish they\\'d be more honest.Exactly! Communication is the big problem here. My hope now is that, when more European countries get Disney+ without this content, there will be a bigger outcry about it, making Disney listen.Yeah, they see non-US territories as second class, even though Dumbo (1940s) ironically bombed because of WW2 and being unable to show it abroad.Before Disney+ launched I heard the theory that the EU has set a requirement for non-European streaming services to offer a minimum percentage of content produced in the EU. I am not sure if this is true. If so, it may be the case that Disney tries to realize this percentage by cutting back on US-produced content (because they simply don’t have enough EU-produced stuff). But then they could have cut back on live-action Disney Channel crap instead of on quality animation material and Walt-era content!Again, I am not sure if this is the reason.Does that mean the UK will get that US content back next year, since we leave the EU by then officially.The sources can be spoofed. The key is, whatever the emails are asking you to do. If this was just telling you that you have a refund, then there’s not much to worry about... other than making sure your account(s) are set up the way you want.But if it’s saying something like “We are having a problem refunding your account, please click...” then it’s probably a scam.The rule I tell my mom and grandma is, no matter how legit and reasonable an email seems, never click on anything in it. If you have a problem, go to the website yourself. Or call them at a number you are positive is them, not just a number written in the email.Have you tried contacting them through the website?Did the email ask you to do something, like click on a link in the email, log into your D+ account, and verify the information? That would raise a big, red flag to me.If its not something you requested then don\\'t click any links in the email and contact them officially .I compared this to my refund email I got and it looks identical, cant verify the email it came from aince I cant see it. although I did request a refund for a double subscription that I somehow got signed up for and ended up getting the one I asked for and another one on top of it. You could always start a chat with disney and ask.Look at the from email closely and make sure it isn\\'t some off-spelling of the real disney customer service.  I got a legit looking email from microsoft but the senders email actually said \\'micrasoft\\' so....lol.But yeah check the sender\\'s email address to see if it\\'s a legit disney+ one.I tried to cancel and they signed me up for the bundle, tried to cancel that and got 2 cancellations... But I\\'m on month 2 if the bundle. Have an email going. Might have to just stop payments at the bank level next month.Not to get off track, but what is this about a random 13 year old using your email to sign up for ESPN? That sounds like the real story here.Oh, and be wary of phishing emails. It enables tech savvy teenagers to gain access to your accounts and sign up for various streaming services.damn I had the ESPN issue too! what an annoying situation that was.Glad it was legit and u got creditsNo action, just “a refund is on the way”.I was just asking here incase it was a mass “oops” email sent out to a bunch of people.I’ll give it a day or so and see if a refund appears on that card, if so, this was legit, but weird experience.I have a very old email, like the start of gmail old.To avoid having some stupid email like “xxOneWingAngelxx1538474@aol.xom” on resumes,I went with a nice simple (firstLetter).(lastname)@gmail.comThis also means that every person out there that also matches that patter has tried to signup for that same email a few times, got told “it’s taken, but let’s add some numbers to the end”, but they forget those random numbers (or what’s worse is the old people who use their year of birth, and still forget it, but #oldpeopleontech stories are another day)I get A LOT of emails meant other people, or “Welcome to SERVICE” and “welcome, click this to confirm this email is real and we’ll create the account, link expires in 3 days” type stuff. I meant a LOT, like 5 to 10 a day.It’s become a part time hobby replying to the person2persone ones and clicking “no, I didn’t sign up” or “please unsub me from this store mailing list that I’ve never been to that someone gave their email at the register but forgot the numbers”Anywho, some years ago, some kid with a first name that started with the same letter as my first name... was making a bunch of sports related accounts, MLB.com and such, all the same stupid username and same profile pic, but he kept using MY email.I tried to close as many of them as I could. Usually by resetting the password (which remember goes to my email), going in and close/delete account etc. usually not an issue.One I couldn’t get deleted as ESPN, because big mouse really likes data retention and gotta keep those account growth number trending upwards! And I couldn’t change the birthday either. So I left it.Fast forward a bunch of years, I’m signing up for D+, I hit no problems, I use it for about a day or so, and the account goes dark, blocked/banned.Sit on hold for almost two hours (they had issues going on) finally get someone, he explains it’s locked because “I am under 18”, I explain no, I’m in my 30s, and how they would know that, it never asked me for a birthday when I signed up.He explains that it auto matched my email, not with my (also as old as launch) Hulu account, which is also confirmed and has billing info on it, but instead with another disney owner property, ESPN. And just decided to merge these account together, because they are obviously the same person. (I read off the user info and what not from the ESPN emails from 2015 which I still have because I have gigabytes upon gigabytes of email storage because ancient account, so I never deleted ANYTHING)And that ESPN account, based on the birthday that is written in stone in the profile, makes me like 16yo, so immediately PERMABAN/HARDLOCK forever, your email is now burned and can never be used on any Disney product (at least not for the next 3years I imagine)Their official suggested support method was “just create another account using another email”, that’s right, official fix for this age related ban, is ban evasion. I never blinking so hard in my life.I just did same email, but adding a “+disney” (which was funny because you know, “Disney plus” to the end  of the mailbox, because gmail supports “plus routing” because these big dumb servers only see emails as absolute strings, so obviously these are two entirely different emails. And it let me sign up, did it live on the phone, and he confirmed my account and added a month credit to it since the dead account was billed.Oh yeah, that’s the best part, they charge you when you get banned like this, and you can’t login to remove your billing info.I was told the old would be cleared up and everything would be fine from here on out. It wasn’t.A month later, my credit runs out, that’s fine, and before I could put in a credit card and resub, I get charged, but like the thing that started this thread, that charge email referenced the old (locked) email. So back to the phone queue.Turns out the first tech did his job sloppily, and never actually cleaned up the billing info from that first account, which would have just kept being charged forever (for a service I can’t log into mind you, not happy about that)Got it cleaned for real, ANOTHER credit was added my new account, (which still has no billing info on it) because it’s a net 0 game, Disney got a month worth of charge in their coffers, and I get a month of view time. I’m ok with this.Fast forward, it’s now March, and I’ve been successful charged for feb and March, on the new email and the new credit card number (yay burner e-cards) and all is fine and then out of now where, bam, I’m getting those original charges refunded? That “I requested”? It seemed strange, but all totally plausible, just out of the blue.I\\'ve seen the same situation posted here about 2 weeks ago or so. Appears to be legit, especially since they\\'re not asking for action to be taken. I think the last instance, the user was actually double charged, so the refund was for that.I’m going to chime in and say that yes, while spoofing is very good, Gmail is also excellent at detecting it. Personally I think they’re better at this stuff than Microsoft (unless you’re paying for their higher tier licenses for your own hosted email through them and set it all up properly but the average person is just making an @ gmail address).There’s things such as DKIM that checks keys to make sure it’s coming from a legit source, and google would have checked the sender IP against Disney’s MX and SPF records. Adding on top that this email isn’t asking you to click anything or do anything, I’d say it’s likely a legit error on D+’s part. Maybe an email blast to a subset of users that was unintended. Wouldn’t be surprised if in a day you get an “oopsie” email from them about it. Your best bet is to contact them outside of any links in that email and ask them directly. If you’re really worried change your password to something unique and random. Use a password manager. Source: I do IT work for a living. Domain and email setup including proper anti-spoofing/anti-spam setups constantly.It took me about 3 days or so to see the refund I believe, but for sure keep an eye out. Although for weird surprises, getting money back would be one of the few surprises I would welcome hahadoes your visa end in the numbers in the email if so then its probbaly some dude pressed the wrong buttonThis is still a common scam, they don’t ask you to contact them or anything because that’s what looks suspicious. They want people to see it and think “oh I don’t want my account to be cancelled” and then *voluntarily* click the fake contact link or phone number or whatever and pay some kind of fee to make sure their account isn’t blocked, usually like $10 or something innocent enough that they never second guess it but if the scammers email a million people and only a hundred fall for it, that’s still a grand in the bank.I work in a tech support type job and we’ve seen the same fake emails come from Netflix, D+, iCloud, Microsoft, cable companies, cell phone providers, basically anything that you could pay monthly for, people fall for these scams *constantly*.(Posting again because I was removed due to a no-no word)Yes, it was the numbers of the card I had on that account at the time (virtual card via privacy.com), and the then email was correct also.If all of this had happened 2months ago, when it was within a week or so of me contacting support, I wouldnt have questioned it. But it has been 2 full billing cycles since then.Makes sense. I guess I\\'m just used to the typical scamsDisney Plus isn\\'t launched in the UK yet.They will add it at some point. In the meantime you can cast from your phone or tabletI don\\'t get why the apps dont go on firesticksDamn I’m excited for this!From reading the list. They have my subscription for definite.Awesome listIreland is not part of the UK, but you can use your account across the border, according to **DisneyPlus Help**:>\\t**Can I watch Disney+ abroad?**>\\tWhen you are abroad, you can watch any downloaded content in offline mode.

I wish they had an option to not do this, or at least make it easy to go back to the credits. I fight with D+ just last night so I could watch the in-credits scenes in an avengers movie.it\\'s device specific. I can only talk to the way I do it with AppleTV, but if you hit the Menu button on the AppleTV remote when it happens, it returns you to the movie.Hope that helps.I have the same frustration with fire stick! It doesn’t make sense, and I’ve tried everything I can think of and haven’t discovered a work around.I think if you log in from the internet you can delete everythingWell, I checked it again today, and now the app doesn’t even show that 4K is available for movies. Newly released vizio app streamed at 4K thoughWell...  just going to reply to myself.  Got my new TV today...  played with the Fire stick and Disney+ just a bit.  Watched some Mandalorian and live action Aladdin.  Both streamed in 4k off the fire stick without issue...   data usage on the internet connection wandered from 17Mbps to ~ 21Mbps, so definitely getting a 4k stream...Colors on Aladdin looked great, definitely better than 1080 blueray to my eyes, but maybe that\\'s just the \"new TV effect...   :)  The HDR indicator never displayed though, so don\\'t know for sure why not...  but some of the highlights really did seem to pop, so dunno.....   definitely got some more playing to do, but things look promising....I was definitely getting a 4k stream in my very brief testing today.....Unfortunately you’re out of luck if you want to binge the entire MCU series on Disney+. The Spiderman movies are owned by Sony, and The Incredible Hulk movie is owned by Universal, so those movies will never be on Disney+.You really shouldn’t be paying $12 for just Disney+ and ESPN+, go ahead and get the Hulu bundle for $12.99 a month. Hulu has a bunch of content to watch in addition to everything else.But the Star Wars, Pixar, and MCU movies owned by Disney that are missing on Disney+ are on Netflix and they’ll be on the service by the end of 2020 after they’ve expired on Netflix. Just gotta be patient.If you don\\'t like the service, then cancel it. Why pay for something that you are waiting for a year to come back?That\\'s the point of streaming. You cancel the streaming when the service doesn\\'t have what you want to watch at the moment. I can\\'t think of anyone that pays for every service 12 months every year (other than maybe Amazon Prime). I subscribe to different services, but I don\\'t pay for them every month (2 months max). I cancel and move onto something else or skip the month.Don\\'t, if that\\'s how you feel.Why should you keep it? Because you like the service. Why should you drop it? Because you don\\'t like it.It\\'s really that simple. I like it for my reasons, others like it for their reasons, and others don\\'t like for what ever reason they want. So you have to look at the service and make that decision yourself.Its your money. Spend it or don’t.Have you checked out the imagineering story? What about all the marvel animated series? Or clone wars and rebels cartoons? Gargoyles is a classic series to check out. Plus tron uprising.It\\'s a new service, it takes a while to get up and running and it also takes time to make new content...Just delete it then watch Mando season 2 and the other Marvel shows through alternate \"methods\"... That\\'s what I might do, the service is total garbage, so limited it\\'s terrible. Hoping it flips eventually so they can wake up and stop being childish. They should\\'ve just merged this with Hulu and make it available everywhere elseThis wasn’t bitching statement like I guess everyone is taking it to be. It was a honest question of what am I missing. I pay for, but never watch Disney. I have Hulu, which I am keeping which is why I said $12. If I do the math, it’s actually about $8 I pay. Not a lot, and I didn’t really cut the cord because of the money (other than I hate giving it to Comcast) but I do have a loose budget and i am thinking of signing up for Spotify family. I was hoping someone had in insight into series they liked, or series coming up etc, but if I am just paying for them to get up and running by the end of 2020, that’s kinda silly. Thank you for your reply.Alternatively, unsubscribe, then resubscribe when something you want to watch is added.  If enough people do this, Disney will (hopefully) learn what they need to do to get people\\'s money.That’s why streaming is good.  Cancel and pick up later when there are some things to watch.If it helps, all of the Star Wars, MCU, Disney Animation, and Pixar content will be back on the service by the end of July, minus Ralph breaks the Internet. So I would probably cancel Disney+ for now, and come back at the end of July and see how you like it. And if you’re only a seasonal watcher for the Mandalorian then that’s perfectly fine!If eventually you’re wanting to binge the entire MCU through streaming you can always purchase the movies that aren’t available on Disney+ through iTunes. There’s only 3 movies total so that’s really doable.Otherwise, I’m guessing The Incredible Hulk will be on Peacock in mid July, and I’m not sure where the Spiderman movies will end up, but hopefully on Sony’s Crackle at some point. Both services are free with ads.Wreck it ralph!!!\"Alexa, make a man out of me.\"*Alexa plays Mulan on TV*I’m confused. I’ve had Disney+ on my Fire TV since it launched?Hey Disney, howsabout fixing the missing features like Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision for existing apps like Roku and Xbox first, before adding Alexa voice commands. Thanks.Great even more Alexa accessI thought the same thing, as I’m watching right now on Fire TV, but the article says it’s for customers in the UK. Hope that clears up your confusion.Yes, maybe it didn\\'t have in-app voice support?What country are you watching it from?Luke, je suis ton pèreYup it\\'s only available in French at the moment ... talked to live support and they confirmed they only saw french available ( I\\'m in quebec canada) however we watched episodes 1 2 3 no issues... seems like a coding issue with french and english in Canada... wish it was fixed faster been months of credits in french audio english and now just no english etc.... sucksSame issue for me in Canada,  Apple TV, PS4, Samsung tv and my PC(all browsers and windows app.   I saved a bookmark for the English audio somehow so I’m using that to bring up the English audio on my PC,  then I hit continue playing on another platform,  As Canadians,  we don’t really register for a company the size of Disney,  the point is to be as annoying as we can so they WANT to make us go away.Been an ongoing issue.. another post had solutionsCanadaNON!!!yea about a month ago I was watching the original trilogy and the opening crawl was in French and now even the audio is. Wish they would fix this fastermind linking the other post?I can\\'t guarantee you that this will work, but I\\'ll speak from experience with the Disney+ app on my Samsung TV. I am also streaming from Canada.Try doing this to fix the issue: using the Star Wars menu, navigate to Episode IV: A New Hope and begin playing it (restarting from the beginning). After watching through the first few minutes, presumably presented to you in French incorrectly, exit out to the main menu where you will now see the option to resume it. Next, navigate to Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (which should be correctly playing in English) and fast forward to the end credits. If your Disney account has \"suggestions\" enabled in the profile settings it should recommend playing Episode IV: A New Hope. Shortly into the credits, you will be presented with the option to play or view details for Episode 4. Do NOT select details, instead select the play button. The movie should begin playing once again from the start in English video and audio. Be careful that the next time you are on the home menu, there will now be two different language versions of Episode IV: A New Hope available to resume under the \"continue playing\" header.I believe that somehow, having the French version of the movie already started causes the suggestion prompt to default and start a new English stream. I have been able to reproduce this effect and watch the English version of Episode IV: A New Hope several times, however every time I begin playing it from the regular menu it still plays only in French. Disney needs to fix this problem for the majority of English speaking Canadians.Yeassss this worked thank you! We are french so there was no issue understanding it but would rather it as it was recorded !!!!Thank you so much!Glad to hear that from another user, I am going to post the relevant information on this subreddit later. Respect for the French, I could never learn the language well enough but Quebec is beautiful!Doubtful we can do anything hereI vaguely remember thisDirected by Savage Steve Holland, who made *Better Off Dead* and *One Crazy Summer* before moving to kids TV.

Just commentedREI stall app?Hey thanks for replying! I tried reinstalling the app and it didn’t initially work. It’s mostly fixed now (I think?) with Doug being the only exception. When you finish the last episode it just replays the whole series from s1e01. With everything else I’ve tried (The Simpsons, Spider-Man, Tangled the Series Etc) it naturally closes out and says “Because you watched...” with some recommendations. Maybe there’s something wrong with Doug specifically.Apps tend to launch the same.day from.what I seeOk Hope you’re right. I don’t want to have to watch it on my laptop :)What about casting it from.your phoneIf you mean like screen sharing then I think it won’t be Necessary cuz if there’ll be a phone app then there’ll probably be a smart tv app as wellWell yea naturally. U just said watching on ur laptop lol so u kind of confused me lmaoIt\\'s possibleIt\\'s supposed to be comingI agree, this does seem possible.How exactly? I can\\'t find the option to link it to the assistant. Only Netflix and YouTube movie. That\\'s through the google HOME application.Username checks outIt could happen in the future. Did you tried saying\"play the mandalorian on Disney+?I need Coming Soon section like Netflix have.> just the important ones.That\\'s a terrible way to do it. \"Important ones\" is very subjective.Wasn\\'t Bedtime Stories a rerelease? I think it was on Disney+ earlier but removed temporarily. Maybe only movies that haven\\'t been on Disney+.It doesn\\'t even list the important ones. Lion King was just released in Australia but its not on the Row. I feel like its literally someone\\'s job to add stuff manually to that list because it definitely isn\\'t automated. None of the classic cartoons they added in the last week are on that list.I think they just need to.notify better of adding and removingIt wasn\\'t on disney+ until yesterdayIt had a landing page at launch, but was never actually on the service until now.At least you had classic cartoons added! We are still looking at only 10 of them... only one has been added since launch in November!As long as you are getting new content, I wouldn’t worry too much about whether it’s listed in the ‘What’s new’ section or not.A somewhat good site to see what\\'s new on ANY service is [JustWatch](https://justwatch.com). Is a life saver.I have the same issue. Running WebOS 03.01.00. No WebOS updates available. Same error as aboveIve seen a lot of broken hearts relying on facts and news broken via a support chat... keep your expectations managed...In Germany too?If yes, I will take your entire stock.Meh I thought this was for season 2.A person on chat isn’t confirmation, unfortunately. They’re often misinformed.Is this for some non-US market?In Germany the first episode of The Mandalorian will be available on Free TV (Pro 7)This makes we happy inside!wait Disney+ isn\\'t even \"out\"?Good! That’s a good policy! I’m proud of them. Hope you all enjoy the binge while you can :)I hope their servers are ready for that.this will make no sense for you if u live in the us, some countries don\\'t have disney plus yetto be fair its already aired so why hold back lol....when season 2 comes around it will be episode by episode again....not sure why this post has so many upvotes did people really think they would go episode by episode for a season that already aired lol?Never believe support chat. Lol your crazy if you do. They don\\'t know anything. Go look at any gaming subreddit. Never pans out. Reddit should have a rule about this postI\\'m happy and excited for all of you who haven\\'t had a chance to watch The Mandalorian yet. You are in for a real treat. In North America we had to wait for each episode to be released weekly but honestly I\\'m glad they did it that way. I got to participate in watching parties every Friday night with friends and it was so much fun. I would advise you to try and hold off binge watching the entire series. Try and pace yourself  over time so you can savour it. You won\\'t regret it. This is the way.Thank god this is a smart move by DisneyGood job DisneyI prefer my shows released all at once. I have limited time so if my free day is the day after release I can binge 3-4 episodes and then binge again next time I\\'m free.How did you get that many messages in within a minuteMakes sense. Enjoy UK’ers!!!Monica and Joey are gonna be fuckin pumpedListen for the little sound baby Yoda makes at the 7:13 mark of episode 4.It’s my favorite part of the show.Very likely false info. They are wrong a lot on their support chat.I  honestly don\\'t take the support chat as viable information, usually it\\'s wrong.  However I can only see bad PR if they did release them weekly after all the other regions have it already. The delayed launch already has people annoyed, making them wait to watch the biggest exclusive show they have will only put more backlash on the service.I hope your rep is rightWell why would it be released weekly lmao they’re not new episodes anymore.They said they wore going to roll out episodesWe need weekly episodes, binge watching ruins water cooler talk, meaning you have to dodge spoilers on a constant basis, online or offline.  I miss regular TV because I had a sense of connection with others, like I know if I’m watching an episode of friends in TV, I know for a fact other people are watching the same episode as me at the same time, to be it was a sense of connection, streaming makes me feel almost like I’m isolated, doing something alone, idkThe whole FIRST season. Of course all episodes will be available, since the 1st season is complete already.I hope this is just for S1. I really, really love the weekly  releases[deleted]And I’m back on board. I saw the prior situation as poor management but fixing their mistakes gives me faith.I don’t like that.  I liked the old school anticipation and waiting.[removed]Bro Mandalorian is over that was a long time agoYeah this wouldn\\'t be the first time customer service has been wrong about this kind of thing.And I’m relieved it isn’t. I hate having to scramble to watch the shows I care about before some buffoon without a life watches it all on 2X speed and spoils everythingThat would be a terrible move by DisneySeason 2 filming now, will be released in Nov it looks likeIt’s the streaming equivalent of the Disney World bus driver. Well intentioned but often misinformed.Oh sorry forgot to say U.K.[deleted]We’ve been using Disney-.It is in some countries. And the others had to wait so long for Disney Plus now. We actually had to wait a week longer but I\\'m glad they pushed it forward to one week. So that\\'s just fair. Also a TV Channel in Germany will show the first episode of The Mandalorian. Thanks to god.I mean after seeing the UK library I’m done with whatever.The U.K. was told they would have to wait despite it already being released in USIn the Uk we wore initially told otherwise.There was a post someone not to long ago saying it was still being released weekly.Glad it\\'s not.[deleted]It\\'s for international releases for the shows that already premiered. There would be no sense in releasing them as if they were first premiering.Despite the misunderstanding, I agree with you. I thought this post was for season 2 and now I’m relieved it isn’t.Maybe it’s a generational thing, but people forget how great it was discussing shows with friends and coworkers week to week. Imagine if the final season of Lost dropped all on one day lolUkAnd I love the weekly discussion threads.It makes it easier to read them as opposed to a whole season.The weekly hits thousands of comments, but at least the Easter eggs are highly upvoted. Imagine in a whole season. I missed so much in Daredevil simply because it was in binge format.I\\'m still shocked noone spoiled baby Yoda for me. I think we waited two weeks to watch the pilotI know that guy!Yep. Only Netflix releases entire seasons in one day, and it\\'s a terrible strategy. It\\'s the reason why people constantly complain about Netflix lacking in content even though they actually have as many good shows as any other streaming service. It\\'s just that audiences spend two whole months experiencing The Mandalorian or GoT and only two days watching Stranger Things.I\\'m one of those that likes to binge in a short period of time but yeah screw spoilers.The bad thing about Season 1, is that literally half of it is filler, which sucked watching week-to-week. It wouldn\\'t have been as bad with a binge watch.HHahahaha so true[deleted]Ooooooh didn’t know that partNo really.  You misinterpreted it.If you been support chat then I feel bad for you son. You need to be less gullible. They lie all the time and don\\'t know jack. This post are the same that people post in like gaming subreddits and I honestly don\\'t think 1 of them as ever been correctSeason 2 will be released weekly.Ah. Ok.  Makes sense for international.Do you think that friends and coworkers aren’t talking about tv shows now? Because that’s inaccurate. If it’s a weekly show, you talk about it the same way. If it’s all released at once and you binge, all you have to do is ask “what episode did you get to” and not be inconsiderate and spoil everything for them. People are still talking about tv.Exactly! There’s a communal aspect to watching weekly shows that you don’t get when everything drops at once.Stranger Things 3’s release on the 4th of July last year was when it really became clear to me that I don’t like the binge format. Not only did it alter my plans for that week, but everyone moved on so quickly that no one was even talking about it anymore after like 10 days.I think that\\'ll be fine for season 2. But making markets like the UK who have had to wait this long for it wait for them to be drip fed would have been a bad move.Has anywhere ever done Daily releases?That seems like a good compromise. It\\'s still a big event as it means a few weeks are devoted to the show. People with lives can still watch it without forgetting what happened last week. And you can still have decent discussion threads.Wow, that’s actually impressive. I feel like I was seeing memes within the first week!Amazon released all of The Expanse season 4 at once[deleted]What? This hasn’t hurt them at all. They are the ones that basically invented the “binge” craze. It’s fine if it’s not your cup of tea but to say it’s a terrible strategy is just flat out wrong. Also, there are many people (including me) who prefer episodes to come out all at once then weekly.[deleted]Yeah im talking about season 1Personally, I’ve had a lot of stuff unintentionally spoiled for me.It\\'s like they sacrifice their shows. They\\'re a trending topic for a couple days and then completely disappear from discussion for the next year and a half.AgreedI think they made the right move.I didn\\'t realize Apple TV or Amazon did that, I guess because I only have Netflix, Hulu, D+ and HBO. Which Hulu originals have been released all at once?And no one is forcing people to binge. I very rarely binge a show. I watch shows at my own pace.  If that means I\\'m a year behind everyone else, so what?[deleted]Oh yeah, for sure. Not everyone catches that “don’t be inconsiderate” step, or for whatever reason spoilers aren’t a big deal to them. My work schedule doesn’t really allow for me to watch things live, so my whole life is dodging spoilers.Actually I think that binging allows shows to get away with worse pacing and writing. Not completely bad but like how many of the shows you’ve binged would you have sat down once a week to watch?Game of Thrones Season 8 suffered horrifically (in general) because of its writing because week after week people were able to glom on to every single detail and they talked about it for months and months.If it had dropped all at once 10 days of grumbling and moving on.[deleted]>so what?So you run the risk of being spoiled because some idiot can\\'t figure out how to write a post without putting a spoiler in the title, even though every tv sub has that as a rule. And god forbid you complain about it, just so some wankstain can PM you who got murdered that week on AHS.[deleted]Fair point but idk if bingeing would\\'ve saved the season. 6 episodes and 1 year break were worse mistakes imo. But I wonder how much that would\\'ve changed things.True.I find it easy to avoid spoilers. I simple don\\'t read anything at all or watch any videos about a show I\\'m watching until I\\'m all caught up.But why be so condecending about your country having disney+ already and some not?Which is easy enough if people obey the \"no spoilers in titles\" rule. But they don\\'t, and I shouldn\\'t have to unsub from every American television subreddit just because I don\\'t live in that country.A lot of people are still going to the cinemas. They’ll still make more in cinemas than if they change their whole pricing model to allow IAP for single movies rather than subscriptions.If they do anything, they will just delay the release. The new James Bond movie release was pushed from April to November because of it. It\\'s a lot easier and gets the movie released than it is to set up a pay-per-view type system on D+ to show new releases. By the time they had the infrastructure set up and ready to go, the whole coronavirus media-hyped paranoia scare will be over and long gone.This has to be the worst decision Disney will ever make. They’ve been planning to release Mulan in theaters for a long time. Plus, Mulan is a big budget movie. Disney releasing it on Disney+, they’ll lose all the money on that movie and will make nothing compared to what they would make when released in theaters.When movie studios were toying around the idea of delivering new movies directly to homes, the price point proposed was $50-$60 (since each viewer would normally buy their own ticket in the theater). $5-10 is what they get during the normal rental window. On Disney+, each individual film only earns fractions of pennies on each household subscription, and Disney+ isn\\'t set up for premium rentals. Mulan is still tracking for a $85M release weekend in the U.S., but the marketplace is really interesting right now. Basic Hollywood math is if Mulan doesn\\'t make $400M+ in the domestic box office, Disney will have to take a write down on it.At this point, the worst decision Disney will make could result in a multitude of people getting infected with Coronavirus.This is bigger than finances. Releasing it on Disney Plus doesn\\'t mean they can\\'t re-release the movie in theaters once the virus scare wears down.These are pretty unique circumstances. Most people are staying indoors, not going to the movies.That $50 price tag was because they expect multiple people would be watching. If you go to a theater to watch a family film, you could easily spend more than that with Mom, Dad, and couple (2 or 3 ) kids tagging along. It never really went anywhere , and the thought died out. At least I haven\\'t heard any more talks about it for a few years now.I think at some point, we may move to more of a pay-per-view system, where you can rent for higher cost initially, and as time goes on, the price drops. Right now, people are still OK paying the ticket prices at the theater, but there will come a point when it gets too high that they decide to stay home. And that\\'s when I think this concept will be revived and talked about again.You have a good point. Movie theaters are the worst place to be at I mean you’re in a enclosed room for hours and citizens can easily just cough and sneeze and it’ll be in the air. I’ve actually read a news article that someone received measles from a movie theater.>where you can rent for higher cost initially, and as time goes on, the price dropsWe\\'re kinda already there. Movie prices are always highest upon release.I was just talking to a buddy about seeing a movie next week with him. After realizing how bad this virus has gotten, I\\'m like, \"Nope.\"Going to a movie theater these days is basically begging for the virus to get you.\\\\I\\'m excited Hocus Pocus 2 is happening, but I want Kenny Ortega back!Hopefully they do a decent jobAgreed this guy seems terrible.I wonder if they’ll have the aspect ratios fixed for the launch.Then ratio better be fixed by thenstark raving dad may be the only missing one, just like in america.Except for Season 31 which will still be on Sky (in the UK), and will only get on Disney+ at a later dateWill be this including nordics in summer or just uk an france etc this monthI posted this and my post was taken down...Already been postedBeen posted. I think the latest season isnt includedWhy is it missing?And AustraliaNovember to be specific.michael jacksonWow. I\\'m so happy I own the DVDs.Is Homer vs NYC still censored because they show the Twin Towers?*No. No it does not. This was either cruel or you are misinformed.**\"Details\" shows everything that the program is *possibly* available in. In fact, that\\'s exactly how you know It\\'s not available. That stuff in the Details has always shown Atmos for Star Wars, Marvel, etc. Atmos however, still does NOT show up under any of the titles when you click on it. TFA says right under the Play button: >PG-13 2015•2h 18m. Science Fiction, Action-Adventure 4K Ultra HD HDR10•5.1That\\'s where you would see Atmos or Dolby Vision. You can just assume that any feature that you see in the Details section, but not there, ISN\\'T AVAILABLE DUE TO APP CONSTRAINTS... especially when you have Atmos upscale already running on Xbox.To the OP r/tenny80 :1st, I\\'m sorry to come off as aggressive, and assuming you are spreading false truths about Atmos on this app. Let\\'s be more civil here. I don\\'t appreciate you knocking my music surround preference either, but I\\'ll let that go. For the record, I think 4 channel stereo is actually much worse sounding and detrimental for music than what Dolby does with keeping the soundstage in the front. You can disagree with this if you like, but is irrelevant to this discussion. So I\\'ve been fiddling with Atmos settings on Xbox today, and all I have found is that when you select Atmos in the settings, EVERYTHING is mapped to Atmos, for me. All of the time... When you select \"Channel Upmixer\" (found in ther Dolby Atmos app), everything is upscaled within that mapping. To be clear, even with the upmix off, every single app and dashboard comes through either in native 5.1 or whatever, but my receiver ALWAYS shows Atmos because it\\'s routed this way. (Spotify comes out as 4Ch Stereo, but mapped to Atmos) When I listen to anything with the upmix turned on, it also shows Atmos 5.2.1, but the sound is being directed to include the height speakers, which are silent in almost all media. I\\'m really curious how your Xbox is handling Atmos differently. Is it possible that you have a different dashboard ver.? I\\'m on 10.0.18363.9135It shows atmos for me, look at the picture. My avr also detects atmos https://imgur.com/a/jpczrbyI am on 9135 xbox one xAudio out Hdmi audio - bitstream Bitstream format - atmos for home theaterHeadset Audio - windows sonic Atmos app settings are disabled and maybe that\\'s the difference. It says I have to enable atmos for headphones so maybe that\\'s why mine is not up mixing like yours.YouTube Onkyo avr reports 2.0 input 2.1 outputSpotify Onkyo avr reports 2.0 input 2.1 output Disney+Dr Oakley s1 ep 2Disney+ reports hd 5.1Onkyo avr reports direct 5.1Rogue oneOnkyo avr reports atmos 5.1.2Maybe my settings are all messed up or my harmony remotes switching them when I open the app?Play something that doesnt have atmos it will show you the same exact thing, mine does at least.Um, that\\'s because your Xbox is UPSCALING EVERYTHING to Atmos. I\\'m not trying to be rude, but do you notice that everything that comes through your Xbox (including YouTube videos) are now Atmos too?Don\\'t get me wrong, having the Atmos upscale is a nice feature. What it isn\\'t though, is real Atmos.Also on Onkyo receiver, and I will check on that more later. One thing I did notice today was that the receiver has buttons for music, movie, or game that sort of reprocesses the signal afterwards to other modes. It can even collapse Atmos to stereo or mono, oddly. I had to make sure this extra processing was off, and still was always direct Atmos until the end. But yeah, for me, it\\'s either all Atmos or no Atmos, and either upmix everything or nothing. I do have the headphone app also, but I think this shouldn\\'t engage unless it\\'s outputting through the controller (or whatever headphone method selected) If I  switch headphone setting to Windows Sonic, it doesn\\'t effect the receiver Atmos setting.Isn\\'t Video streaming always basically upscalled dolby plus surround?no I don\\'t when I play a different show on Disney Plus it is not in Atmos. I\\'ve never seen anything from Youtube in Atmos either.What their Atmos feature does (when you download it and check the dialog box) is essentially map **everything** to Atmos, including the dashboard sounds. The only thing you\\'ll currently get in native Atmos is a few games that.I support it, as well as UHD Blu-ray, which will actually goes through another mode to pass through whatever is native on the disc.My absolute FAVORITE thing about Xbox Atmos is the way it handles Spotify! It\\'s honestly the greatest way to listen to music I\\'ve ever had the pleasure I\\'d listening to. It sometimes even sounds as good as some true surround mixes that I\\'ve heard. All sound is Atmos mapped, and there is a slider, so you can be in a game, watching a nature movie on any streaming app, whatever, and mix the slider to your liking! It\\'s really a magical feature! This is 2.0 sound done right. Sure, my receiver does the new \"Dolby Surround\" upscale too, but this never has to switch from any formats. They all just map perfectly, no matter if game or streaming title is 2.0, 5.1, 7.1, or Atmos.Edit: To answer your question, NO. Streaming version of Atmos would be real Atmos. ie object-based surround. That\\'s unfortunately not what this is.You\\'re full of it. Edit: actually, it sounds like the upscale might be off for you. I\\'ll give you the benefit of the doubt on that. I still don\\'t think it\\'s working correctly, and not really Atmos playing.Where is this slider?My xbox does NOT map everything to Atmos. You must not have yours setup correctly. If I am in Netflix watching a non atmos show the AVR will show something along the lines of DOLBY 5.1, if I switch to Atmos the AVR cuts out for a split second, makes a clicking sound, the atmos speakers on the display light up and the output changes to ATMOS 5.1.2 and sound will come out of my ceiling speakers. When I play Spotify, it plays in 2 channel, not Atmos. You do not have something setup correctly, use the direct setting. Atmos for music sounds TERRIBLE music should only be listen to in 2 channel... 2.1 if your speakers cannot handle bass. You have absolutely no idea what you are talking about.For Atmos Upmix? Right on the Dolby Atmos app.Listen to me man, I\\'ve had a surround home theater for over 20 years, and had a projector as a main display device for over 15 years. I know exactly what I\\'m doing. I absolutely 100% disagree with you on Dolby Atmos for music. In fact, the algorithm that Dolby uses for their new Dolby Surround (way better than DPL-II) has been designed with music in mind. Don\\'t you tell me that 2.0 music sounds better to my ears, when it doesn\\'t. I\\'ve had real, official DTS and SACD discs that were mixed that way by the artists. Guess what? You know what else upmixes 2.0 to surround? Practically every modern car you ever drive or ride in. Even if you turned off your vehicle\\'s back speakers, there is usually processing done to the entire sound field. A lot of cars from the last 15 years even have a center channel. There\\'s definitely surround processing done by modern vehicle \"stereos\". They are also nowhere near as good as what modern Dolby HT surround processing does.I can literally just see some dev writing out the logic of something like “if(expiration<renewal date) display error message” with absolutely zero thought of their 3 year promotion.......This is why I usedPayPal to mask my CC. They don\\'t have access to the card number or expiration date.I thought I was the only one experiencing this issue. So unnecessary and mildly infuriating to see that message pop up. Weirdly enough, it only pops up  when streaming on my laptop. I\\'ve never seen it while using my smart TV or iPhone.Yep! Only on my computer. It doesn’t affect the roku app, Samsung app, or the iPhone app for me at all.Exactly. It’s hard to decide. Right now I think I started like three of the shows. But one of my priorities is to finish Lizzie McGuire if the reboot suddenly comes out soon.Recess!X-Men, bub.No old school Bug Juice. They need to release it.Wakanda Foreverbeen wanting to give this a re-watchTwo more left on Netflix. Infinity War and Ant-Man and the Wasp. 2020 will have all the MCU in one place, minus the Sony and Universal releases.No HD/HDR?So now I know that Disney Plus is getting a bit TOO safe with this photosensitive warning. I actually watched Black Panther, and the only huge flashing lights is a scene in which gunfire is used, and unless you are sensitive to that, then the rest is just the normal neon type effects that have been employed by Marvel for some time (similar to a modern MMO and what they do). I know it\\'s CYA for them, but I just think them adding this warning to EVERY modern Disney theatrical movie can be distressing to those people wondering what Disney is doing with a lot of these movies for them to feel the need to post this warning to everything.Wasn\\'t it already? I\\'m from the Netherlands btwCoolA long time ago...Nice! I remember the first time I met my wife\\'s boyfriend and I greeted him with \"Yibambe!\" He looked at my wife and said \"I see what you mean.\" She must have told him how cool and progressive I am. Black Panther is my favorite movie until they make the sequel of course.At least until 2026 when all of Disney’s movies from 2016-2018 go back to Netflix XD I hope they renegotiate that contract somehow.Honestly they could probably license the Spiderman MCU films for the service on a temporary basis with Sony. Sony doesn’t have much going for it in terms of streaming these days since they canceled the PlayStation Vue.4K HDR is available. Confirmed on my Apple TV.It was not in the US until today.Moved from Netflix to D+ in the US.Not sure why you have downvotes, but okayi thought they only go bacck to netflix for a couple years or something?HDR is still broken on my Galaxy s9+, so I\\'m stuck using the 1.0.1 app still because that\\'s the only one that worksI\\'m not sure either. I guess people don\\'t think Black Panther 2 will be better than the first.I’m not sure how long they’ll be on Netflix for. Maybe just a couple of years, I’m not sure.It’s played in English for me and I watched all the Star Wars movies on Disney+That\\'s been an almost daily complaint from some Canadians since launch. Search some posts and you *might* find some suggestions.Was it playing in English immediately or did you change it somehow?It was immeadietlyPercy Jackson (Lightning Thief) and Cheaper by the Dozen (Steve Martin) are both on in the USA too.I watched Mrs. Doubtfire the week it came out!! 😀And Cheaper by the Dozen the week afterI\\'m so jealous they have Mrs. Doubtfire! I watched Cheaper by the Dozen the first time I saw it listed on Disney+. Always been one of my favorites.Nice! I hope this means that additional classic shorts will also become available in the Netherlands. We only have 10 now, which is a major disappointment. There are about 600 classic shorts, so I had expected a handful of them to be added to the service each month.You might have. I had a situation similar when I tried to get the bundle with Hulu and ESPN+. I tried adding it from Disney then add Live TV to Hulu, but it didn\\'t like that. Had to call Disney, they canceled the bundle, but that messed up my three year subscription. She was able to give me a 1 year subscription, but had to open a ticket with level 3 support to get the remainder of my 3 year subscription I haven\\'t used added back on. She said it could take a week or so (this was just last Saturday), so I\\'m giving them until the end of next week and calling them up if it\\'s not taken care of by then.So call Disney and get this all sorted out. They were very helpful with me getting the bundle, even though they messed up my subscription (which she opened the ticket to get it restored).I had the same problem but I was informed that you should be able to consume your entire years worth of subscription. So Verizon would go first or either way, one of the two will be paused and it\\'ll take about 90 days for your billing to be updated with all the year that you\\'ve got including paid and Verizon.About damn time!Will this show be on Disney+?Season 6 is last year\\'s season. The upcoming Season 7 will be broadcast, in the US, on ABC and will also appear on Hulu.So.. in 17 days?Just FYI, the fifth season is rated 16+ here in the Netherlands and Disney+ lists it as such:  [https://imgur.com/a/8HDIzSV](https://imgur.com/a/8HDIzSV). 16+ is our equivalent of an R rating or TV-MA rating so Disney+ does have adult content here in the Netherlands.YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES ! Two weeks to go. I\\'ve binged all seasons recently and the \\'Hi guys\\' really left me wanting for more...Niiice, it was such a shame it wasn\\'t out yet after I watched the entire first 5 season in around 2 weeks. At that point you just want to keep watchingMeh.Agents of shield is in MCU or not? Talking about i finity saga hereSweet! :)*march 20It is in a few countries, including Netherlands (s1-s5) and Australia (only season 1, I believe).It won\\'t be on Disney+ in the US anytime soon because Netflix has the rights, I thinkConfirmed for UKTrue. ~~Season 5 is also already rated 16 here.~~ So far it\\'s the only thing I\\'ve seen that\\'s 16+ on Disney+. Maybe they are following American ratings. It\\'s not rated R in the US, so it\\'s allowed on Disney+. In that case I don\\'t think we can expect much other 16+ content like Deadpool or Logan.Edit: Little edit after I noticed you were talking about season 5, not 6What was the ‘hi guys’?Completely forgotten S6It’s canon to the MCU but isn’t important to the infinity sagaSadly we are looking at in my opinion five to six to seven years due to Netflix having a really bad licensing scheme going on with TV shows where they keep them many years even after they end. At least with the Disney shows. Liv and Maddie is still there 3 years laterYes Australia only has 1 season and it sucksDo you know if that includes CanadaNetflix only has rights on this season? They never had them before. Usually on abc.[\"Hi guys\"](https://media1.tenor.com/images/8832da74dfe5fa11104358c259a2bdf0/tenor.gif) (of \\'hey guys\\', can\\'t recall)Damn I thought the final season was gonna be on Disney plus?Better than no seasonsNah mate, looks like we got left out here.He means like the streaming rights it airs on abc but then afterwards it goes to Netflix where people can stream it. Same deal is in place with a lot of other abc showsOhhh they bought him back to life and they’ve gone back to like 1930s America. Gonna be dopeBut doesn\\'t it air on hulu the same time each episode is released? That\\'s where I watched the last season 🤔It does. But when the season is over it all goes to Netflix. Like Hulu only has the new episodes as they air.They do that for a few shows, they\\'ll have the five most recent episodes.Great. How about Atmos for Roku Ultra and Xbox. I have both, and both hardware choices support Atmos, but not on Disney+.So frustrating when you know it\\'s there in the content but the app is poorly implemented, and rushed.This reads like an adNow fix the goddamn HDR on Android TV versionsAlso dolby vision?I just bought the new nvidia shield 2019 (not the pro). Updated to 8.1.1. Also updated Disney+ App. Still cannot get Atmos on any of the movies. Gets Atmos on Netflix and Prime. But not Disney+. Help.FYI:Atmos works if you stay on App Version 1.3.On 1.4 it\\'s gone again. (i manually downgraded to 1.3 and it works again)Ultra supports Atmos on Disney Plus....I know because that\\'s what I used to use before getting a Shield... Only to find out it didn\\'t have it.... But stuck with it and now it\\'s back! It was there in the beta for some apparently.What’s wrong with hdr on android tv?Where did you get the APK from? CheersHmm, not on mine apparently. Strange.Edit: looking through the Roku forums, it looks like maybe rebooting to factory settings might make it work? I\\'m gonna try. Otherwise, I like the device.The app doesn\\'t send out a HDR signal to the tv so everything is just in 1080p. It worked a long time ago but now it\\'s broken.I had it from apkmirror.But now ATMOS is gone on the old app too.Also on my AppleTV 4k.So maybe it\\'s a general Problem or to reduce Bandwidth cause of Covid19Try Microsoft Edge.It appears to be in 720p but maybe my eyes are playing tricks on me.You don’t know because we don’t know.Got to be PG-13 or less on the rating.I think Family Guy, American dad etc are PG 13 here in the UK... I think may be wrong.Those shows have different syndication deals than Simpsons hence they will stay on Hulu.I think Family Guy and all the other adult shows and movies will go to Hulu.Probably. We don’t have Hulu in Canada, but I know that is the plan in the USA.Family Guy, American Dad, King of the Hill, Bordertown, Futurama, Son of Zorn, The Cleveland Show, Ghosted, The Orville, Bless the Harts are rated TV-14, like The Mandalorian, and other movies like The Fault in Our Stars and Paper Towns.I hope Hulu eventually goes global.Genuinely curious, why is that?So everyone around the world can watch Hulu. Duh!But what is so great about it?Since Disney Plus is going global, why can’t Hulu also go global?I never said it couldn’t. I said I don’t have access to Hulu in Canada. I have no idea what is on it.  So I’m not getting why it is a big deal to have it go global.I believe that they are planning to roll it out globally.Because it has the Fox/Disney content that doesn\\'t belong on Disney+A Canadian without access to Letterkenny? Now that is a shame..You’re the one that returning all the vids without rewinding!  Please be kind, rewind ;)((Just being silly... sorry I don’t have a real answer for you... I use a different platform.))It\\'s about time they overhauled the app, imo. It feels incomplete.I would try letting the episode play out all the way till it starts countdown to next episode.  Probably a little faster than rewinding.Saaaame like when I’m on Xbox and click Star was the clone wars. It plays the show and there’s no way to view episodes till the end when it’s says see all episodes! It’s frustratingYes, great example!We don\\'t even have season 1 in Canada :(It\\'s on the awful crave app hereWhen the Netflix contract runs out.The latter seasons are rated 15, just wondering whether there’s a sub section to access them without mixing family friendly contents.  I don’t have Disney+ yet hence the curiosity.YesHow awful would it be if they were referring to the movie and not the tv episodes 😂😭I believe this is the first time it\\'s streamed ANYWHERE in the UK, let alone the first 30 seasons.Oh so what about that aspect ratio?Thank god. Was honestly a deal breaker for me.That doughnut is the one Homer was eating on the Simpsons movie poster lool. I think we should wait for actual confirmation that it will be the show and not just the movie...For original authenticity it should say: \"Grab yourself an \\\\*annoyed-grunt\\\\* nut and stay tuned...\"Just about to post this!Was already going to pay for the £50 offer but this is a definite nowWill \"Stark Raving Dad\" be missing in the UK too?And on that note. Just preordered.Finally, some good news! Should we hear more details at the event on Thursday?not so fast>Update: Disney+ UK deleted this retweet after I asked them about the word \"confirmed\" being used. Now it\\'s just the teaser video from earlier this morning. >My guess is that while some Simpsons stuff will be there, it won\\'t be anywhere close to 30 seasons. I\\'ve asked; no commenthttps://twitter.com/loudmouthjulia/status/1234941830791356422Might actually preorder it now...does this go the same for  ireland as well?Does that include Ireland,hope soWait was this not confirmed yet? Literally all I\\'ve been waiting for. Glad it is definitely now Disney and Sky have just signed a new deal so hopefully it’s a big old bunch of episodes!https://deadline.com/2020/03/disney-sky-ink-new-deal-1202872991/I fall for it every damn time.  Pic.vidIs it possible it\\'ll just be the Simpsons movie?Apparently Disney have the rights to the older catalogue of Simpson’s which are arguably the best. It’ll get new seasons at least a year after they premier on Sky. This has upped my interest in getting it nowI’m so happy for the UKThey just confirmed we\\'re getting over 600 episodes. BuzzingYeah the only stations that show it are channel 4 and Sky 1.I’m... so sorry for you guys.This needs to be higher up. I can’t find any official updates on this and it really takes away from the first ~20 or so seasons.It will be in the shape of a triangleThey said early this year but the first quarter is almost over so who knows?That should be fixed when it launches hopefullyI second this. Wasn’t going to subscribe if The Simpsons wasn’t part of the service but would be more than happy to use the early sign-up offer if this does indeed end up being confirmation.Just confirmed on their Twitter that we are getting over 600 episodesExactly what I thought.You mean a D\\'oh!nut?The event has been cancelled, I believe. Blame the coronovirus.Will there be a live transmission of the event ? IF yes, where can I watch it ?That’s a lot of assumptions to make from the deletion of a single retweet. It could also be because Disney want to make an official announcement on Thursday.Over 600 episodes coming to Disney+.. it\\'s now been confirmed!Not sure about Down south tbh. I live in Northern Ireland and we only get it on channel 4 and Sky 1. No other way to watch it.Unlikely, seeing as the movie has already been confirmed.Disney doesn\\'t just have the rights, they own the Simpsons.Works for me, don\\'t have much of an interest in Simpson episodes post 2010Personally I don\\'t think it takes away from it enough to ruin to experience. Everyone points to the same one or two jokes that get cut off but overall it hasn\\'t bothered me too much and I haven\\'t felt like I\\'m missing anythingI do hope they fix it soon thoughNo a donut.WoooshThere will be a small event with select journalist in London still!Works differently internationallyWould you say the same thing to someone who has never seen The Simpsons before? I\\'ve been waiting but I\\'m getting impatient.CoronojournosNo, ownership doesn\\'t change internationally.Rights can, and in the case of the Simpsons does, but that’s something the owner (Disney) gets to work out with distributors.I had never seen the Simpsons\\' early seasons before, so yesEverywhere where you read that Disney+ has issues, it’s 99% on a PS4.Weird. I have it on Roku, Xbox, and PS4. PS4 is the only one I haven\\'t fooled around with munch. I do know that Atmos sound is missing from all options, even though at least Xbox will upscale to it for everything, but D+ won\\'t output it natively. I wouldn\\'t call any version flawless, as I really think the app needs a feature overhaul.Guess Disney still wants Sony to give them 100% control of Spider-Man, so they’re purposely not caring for their service on a Sony platform.It’s also not showing up for me (USA subscriber). Really odd since they’re bringing in the sequels to Sandlot this month. I wonder what the issue is for this movie.If there’s a ton of licensing deals then just don’t bother adding it until it’s free to live on the service. It’s very frustrating to see titles only appear for a week or two.Yes, it\\'s been removed AGAIN. And what do you want to bet, when it comes back, they will advertise it as a \\'new release\\' just like the last time.It’s not appearing when searched for, and when I try to access it through the browser (not logged in) — this message appears! Is it an issue through my side or is it really gone again? I’d like to hear if anyone else is having trouble.Canadian subscriber here, it\\'s still present on Disney+ for us.Does anyone know when this is coming back?  I am extremely disappointed as I wanted to watch this with my kids tonight.I\\'m no longer seeing it either.I agree, it is frustrating. I’m also a USA subscriber and it seems this movie just has a hard time staying on the platform.Must be how the ratings are set for the movie.Cause kids don’t need to be exposed to the horror of Ice Age baby. /sIn all honesty, no one could tell you cause the parental controls on Disney+ aren’t really that good.It’s rated PG, is the kids section G-rated o OT?The kids section doesn\\'t have any PG or PG-13 movies. No Santa Clause 1, but it does have 2 and 3. It might have Frozen though...That makes sense.  I just browsed through the movie content on the kid\\'s profile and it looks like everything is rated \"G\" while Ice Age is rated \"PG\".That baby is quite terrifyingAbsolutely correctThat was itI think Descendants 3 was added now in February, so if the trend if 6 months, then it should be added in August.When is zombies 2 coming to Disney+Probably they will; there are 5 X-Men movies available in the Netherlands now. But it may differ per country and I am not sure they will be there at launch.I\\'m pretty sure they\\'re on Hulu.Hulu is only available in the US and Japan.[deleted]Not all the same. It’s depends on what titles Disney had sold to other services/networks prior to disney+ announcements and when those contracts end. I imagine in the next 5-7 years Disney will have back most of all its content globally so then the platform won’t differ too much from country to country they may have local made content for other regions but will probably be available outside of those regions just buried under other content.Why?It does not only depend on contracts with other networks/services. In the Netherlands a large amount of classic Disney content is missing; this content is NOT available on any other service or network, so there has to be another reason. Unfortunately Disney offers no explanation. What we are missing:- a lot of classic cartoons (we only have 10)- The Rescuers- Mickey’s Christmas Carol- Flight of the Navigator- My Dog, The Thief- I captured the King of the Leprechauns- A Kid in King Arthur’s Court- TaleSpin series- Hercules series- Doug series- Bonkers series- The Emperor’s New School series- Spin and Marty series- Mickey Mouse Club- Wonderful World of Disney episodes- plus a large amount of National Geographic contentA possible reason may be that the EU has posed quota on streaming services: a certain amount of content has to come from the EU. If that is the reason, Ireland can expect to miss out on a lot as well!Netflix Ireland is inferior to USA same with other English speaking Netflix regions.I’m just saying what is the reason also in America. Not everything Disney owns is on there cause the had preexisting deals. In some cases they worked out a deal with who else had the rights. I’ve seen Disney sales reps at markets selling content internationally before the platform was announced so while what you say might be true for EU territories might not be for all. There are just different reasons for each country having different content I just stated one possible reason that I know is affecting a lot of producer backed platforms.No parental lock would have stopped me when I was 10.Brand. Disney and \"R rated\" will never be seen together in any capacity.Because they\\'d rather charge you an additional fee for Hulu to get it. It allows them to maintain brand consistency and charge people twice.That’s what Hulu is for. Rated R content will never be on Disney plus.The worst part is Hulu will eventually just be R rated like stuff only or Disney+ will lose to other streaming platforms for its \"kiddie\" image. I\\'ve heard both praise and complaints for Disney not having R rated stuff. But who\\'s gonna buy Hulu just for R rated stuff? Why split the X-men franchise? Why censor the movie Splash? It\\'s lame and many people\\'s concern before Disney+ even launched.I honestly wish more than anything all the Marvel movies/shows could just be together. That\\'s quite impossible with Netflix and stuff. HBO Max will have adult and kid shows together. It will also be more expensive. So I guess.... whatever. Just wish Disney stops censoring stuff. Hulu at least gives them the opportunity to not do that.[deleted]I just wish they would make Hulu available in NZ if they are not going to put R rated content on Disney+It doesn\\'t matter how many times someone replies with logic to this same complaint. Some won\\'t hear it and there will be another along soon to post something like this again.I\\'ll never understand why some don\\'t understand this.I\\'ll never understand why some don\\'t understand this.They\\'ve made R rated films but under another studio. Also they\\'re allowing Deadpool to stay R rated.But the simpsons is on disney plus?Disney needs to evolve. Its holding itself back because it wants to be kids only. Besides, a bunch of kids have watched R-rated movies anyway.What do you mean? Almost all the Marvel movies are on Disney Plus. The only MCU movie stuff that won\\'t be coming is the Sony stuff. So Spider-man Homecoming, Far From Home, and (not MCU but worth mentioning) Spider-verse. 20 of the 23 MCU movies are on Disney Plus. Homecoming and Far From Home won\\'t come because they\\'re owned by Sony, not Disney. Nothing to do with Netflix. And the third missing one is Incredible Hulk, which really isn\\'t integral to the MCU. That\\'s owned by Universal Pictures. Again, nothing to do with Netflix.As for the shows, I\\'m not too well versed with what\\'s on Netflix at the moment but they should all have their rights expire there and come to Disney Plus eventually. The only shows that probably won\\'t be coming are the Defenders and each of their individual shows, plus Punisher. No idea what\\'ll happen with those. Those are the only things that Netflix will probably keep. Or could end up somewhere else. No clue.Nothing. This is just someone else complaining about the lack of adult content on Disney+.Disney has made literal billions with this model. Why change it?But that wont be \"disney\" it will be whatever the new company was called. This isnt hard,branding is everything \"disney\" means family entertainment. If they wont let their employees I\\'m sorry \"cast members \"point with 2 fingers in theme parks they sure arent going to put a r rated movie out under the brand. Can they be the parent company of a studio that puts out r rated things? Of course. Will it say disney. Never.The Simpsons isn\\'t rated R...They make billions by \"not evolving\".I never watched one as a kid. Just because you did, doesn\\'t mean everyone else did.The Disney brand is synonymous with \"family friendly\" entertainment.  If they threw that out the window, they would lose their grip on the family entertainment market.The Netflix shows are MCU acording to Wikipedia. Even though I know they don\\'t tie too closely to the movies, I wish they all had one home.Because people want mature content, not kids shows nowadays>Can they be the parent company of a studio that puts out r rated things? Of course. Will it say disney. Never.Free guy trailer says otherwise. Then again that could be PG 13He did say a bunch. Not everyone.Well Disney needs to go beyond \"family friendly\" entertainmentits possible to do both imoAh yeah, sorry. I should\\'ve clarified I knew that. That was the part I was agreeing with you. It\\'d be cool for those to have a home on Disney Plus but even if Disney had that option, I don\\'t think they would take because they\\'re not family friendly. Other than those shows though, everything else should be good to come to Disney Plus.*Free Guy* will not say \"Disney,\" it is being released under the 20th Century Studios masthead, which means its headed to HBO anyway.I thought that  was a left over from before the merger?They don\\'t need to do anything. D+ was hyped as much as it was because of how strong the Disney brand is. They gain nothing by diluting that brand.Warner, fox etc do everything and yet neither has a brand that holds anywhere near the same weightThe fact that AT decided to call their own premier service HBO max and not something like Warner play or whatever speaks volumes to the importance of brandingI said TRAILER. Also HBO isn\\'t a thing in the UK so it\\'ll be here more than likely on Disney +. If it\\'s PG 13I\\'m talking about the trailer there\\'s a joke at the beginning saying it\\'s from the studio that bought you Disney films, \"twice\" (reference to the remakes) then proceeding to show a violent trailer.[deleted]And no one does atm barely any Fox films on Netflix here, TV occasionally has a few. Barely any on Sky eitherWandaVision has wrapped filming! Who else is excited for the series?I can\\'t wait for it. Hoping for something unique, and the premise can certainly deliver on that.I loved the Avengers comics from the 80\\'s and 90\\'s and the especially the dynamics of the relationship between the Scarlett Witch and Vision. WandaVision looks like just might capture some of that old magic.Very hyped, and this may sound weird, but I hope it kinda breaks our hearts.And, of course, leads into the Multiverse of Madness.I hope I get Disney+ for my country first. It\\'s one of the series I\\'m most excited about!I’m so looking forward to this! Every time I see a promo pic for it they are in a different decade!This is honestly the Disney+ I’m most excited for. I’m really hoping that it’s a real mindfuck kinda showI\\'m so horny for this show.Im more hyped for this than other marvel series in D+. It looks so good from the trailer.I keep seeing Wandavision but really have no idea what it isThis makes no sense... Falcon And Winter Solider is still filming.This so quickly went from the Disney+ show I was least excited to the one I’m now MOST excited about! It’s going to be so sickI’m unbelievably excited for this. Hopefully we get some more promo material soon.Yeah this looks greatSo I can start streaming when I get home right?  Right?  Please ...I was in Atlanta over the weekend and talked with a bunch of PAs who have been working on the marvel shows. It was exciting to hear about WandaVisonFix the order of Phineas and Ferb please. You are missing episodes too. It has been 111 days come on. Please and thank you in advanceI\\'m hopeful and will give it a go but I\\'m not a fan of sitcoms.I’m excited. Need some more Marvel in my lifeI\\'m on the fence. Will definitely watch it but I still don\\'t get the old school tv show schtick the photos from it have. Kind of turns me off of it.To be honest? I’m really not. I’m not as interested in the Marvel shows as I thought I’d be. Only one I’m actually interested in is Loki.It\\'s based on a comic from the 00s or 10s, IDK haven\\'t read it in a bit, but it\\'s recent-ishA Marvel series following Wanda Maximoff (Scarlet Witch) an the Vision after the events of Avengers: Endgame.The Scarlet Witch can alter reality.I assume it\\'s both a wacky surrealist sitcom and a bridge to the next film.It\\'s based off a really interesting comic book series.Probably a **LOT** more FX work for WandaVision though. We\\'re going to be watching Wanda having a mental breakdown from inside her head.Because FAWS is like full on superhero WandaVision is like half superhero half sitcomI want to see the babies ...It still has to go through post production, including effects and editing. Soundtrack also probably has to be created. It\\'s reached a milestone, but still has a ways to go to reach a final product.I dont think it will be a sitcom. Knowing it ties in to Doctor Strange 2 this show is probably something to do with some sort of magic and what we\\'ve seen so far is just a small portion of thatIt is and it isn\\'t. It\\'s leaning more into a deconstruction of one.Wanda is going crazy. Part of the insanity is creating a world for her and a dead vision to live in. This world is in her mind and hence has old tv shows she use to watch.23 movies later you still doubt Marvel Studios??? Remember how Antman sounded dumb af and he ended up saving the day>but I still don\\'t get the old school tv show schtickIt\\'s all speculation at this point, but the popular assumption is that Wanda is feigning for a \"normal\" picture-perfect life. So she warps her reality to emulate the perfect families she saw on TV.The actual premise of this would obviously only be confirmed from watching it though.It does seem interesting. She messes with reality/timelines and possibly causes shenanigans that leads to the Dr. Strange sequel. None of this might be your cup of tea but it\\'s def my taste and I\\'m so excited!I was trying to be funny.  Just really excited for this.  :DScoring for the marvel stuff is barely scoring. I love the films, but the scoring is pretty meh. It\\'s not like it\\'s through-composed or anything, they edit like trailermusic. Would take longer for a film than tv. FX I\\'m sure will take some time.I don’t think so. My theory is Nightmare (confirmed villain for Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness) has her trapped in some kind of fever dream, and that segways into the movie, which Elizabeth Olsen is confirmed to be in.Gotcha, thank you for that!This makes so much sense. I’ve been so confused how this all connects but if it’s like you say then I think it will be way more interesting than I initially thoughtMy wife thought it sounded dumb until she learned that it was about a guy who could shrink, not a half-ant, half-man hero, as she\\'d originally interpreted the titleSadly, we never got to experience the special-effects maelstrom of Ant-Man becoming “Giant-Man” inside Thanos’s colon.I do not remember Ant-Man sounding dumb at all.I trust the movies but the tv shows are different territory and the approach with Disney + shows and is especially new territory.And ended up being mediocre because they fired Edgar Wright.Instead it was ant man 2 that was dumb.> Scoring for the marvel stuff is barely scoring. I love the films, but the scoring is pretty meh.Music is of course subjective.For me, as a huge soundtrack buff, I love a lot of the Marvel scores though. The Avengers in particular is one of my favorite scores of all time.The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Captain America: The First Avenger, Thor: The Dark World, Ant-man, Spider-man: Homecoming and Black Panther also have incredible soundtracks in my opinion.That would be dope!No problem!Yeah I read that somewhere. It just makes sense.DC’s Legends of Tomorrow did that with the Atom. Except replace Thanos with Rasputin (yeah, that Rasputin) and colon with mouth. Same result though.The idea sounded dumb at first for many many peopleNot if Feige is still involvedThe time to do composition for a show like this (I assume 10 episodes x 20 minutes) would probably be under 2 weeks.It\\'s not subjective. I\\'ve composed (no, nothing you\\'ve seen, not being smug, just nothing popular, unfortunately).3 minutes of scoring where I have to compose takes about a day, longer with complicated orchestrations (usually another day). The trailer music stuff where I hit a BRAAAAMM is closer to foley than scoring. People like it, but it\\'s not that tough. You use one of the libraries. It\\'s also cheaper and quicker than composing the traditional way. There\\'s no need for an orchestra (or even performers beyond the composer), and assembling the score is quicker.You produce music pieces that they edit to film, it\\'s not proper scoring to picture. They don\\'t even give you the film a lot of times. See usually when you score, you see the film in a small window in your software. They used to screen with a piano in old hollywood.When you score tv, you at best, do very limited orchestrations (and you usually don\\'t do that either). It\\'s more likely you either write the theme and then 1) break out Omnisphere or related Kontakt Libraries (Hybrid Tools is a biggie) 2) just score w/piano and stringsYou don\\'t score so you don\\'t really get what I\\'m saying, but you ever watch \"The Flash\" or those DC shows? All 8dio Hybrid Tools. One guy can bang through probably half an episode a day on that. The modern libraries often have entire arps sampled and in some cases phrases.https://8dio.com/instrument/the-new-hybrid-tools-1-instrument-for-kontakt-vst-au-aax/It\\'s not that the guy\\'s not scoring or that the computer does it \"automatically\" or something ridiculous, but this is really closer to foley work to a certain extent. You lay down perc beds, toss down a synth arp and occasionally a theme. The Batman film, which has excellent sound design, but nothing resembling a film score, really kickstarted the trend in film.The guys usually can actually compose btw, but this is what those shows want now, it\\'s quicker and cheaper than proper composition in a light music, John Williams vein.It’s a cool idea and I really hope it’s true.If you think about it, the concept sounds a bit silly. A superhero who can change his size and communicate with insects.If he were a DC hero, it definitely would\\'ve bombed on poor casting alone.*Rob Schneider is.....an ant man!*—\\tDC Marketing team probablyYeah but thats also my point. This new show is presented as a sitcom. Even for me tbh i hate those kinds of shows but im confident Feige has more up his sleeves than just a paint by numbers sitcomIf it was a new character, maybe. But Ant-Man was already an established Marvel superhero.If it\\'s anything like the recent vision comics it will be have more of a horror vibe.The Muppet Show itself is a licensing nightmare because of all guest stars and song covers. Disney has the resources, sure, but if there are parties that don’t want to sell the rights, regardless of price, it’s the end of the story. Same problem for Muppets Tonight I think.The original Muppet Babies: same problem because of all the non-Disney-owned footage that was used.Muppets Take Manhattan and Muppets From Space: both of these movies are owned by Sony/Columbia if I recall correctly.Muppet Family Christmas: this one is going to be tricky because of the appearance of the Fraggles and Sesame Street Muppets. Still, probably easier to arrange than the original Muppet Show. Just not sure if Disney sees it as a high priority.Muppet Classic Theater, Muppet Wizard of Oz, and old specials like The Frog Prince: I am pretty sure these will be on Disney+ eventually. Let’s not forget that the service is only in its fourth month and Disney is in this for the long run. So it makes sense that they don’t put everything on there at once.I would love if they could put up The Muppet Show.  So many great memories for me growing up to that.As others have mentioned, before Disney acquired the Muppets there were other projects that were produced by other studios, like Muppets Take Manhattan & Muppets From Space, who still retain the rights. Muppet Wizard of Oz I\\'m surprised isn\\'t on the service since it aired on ABC and Disney produced it after their acquisition of the Muppets. Also for the Muppet Show logisitcally it would be next to impossible to have the series up in its entirety on the service given the vast number of songs covered that would need to be cleared for use today, while Disney could potentially seek out clearing the rights to the songs featured on the show, financially it likely doesn\\'t make a whole lot of sense to Disney to do that. If you want to revisit the Muppet Show the 1st 3 seasons were put out on DVD. As a Muppets fan I\\'m happy with what we have on D+ I\\'m sure Disney wanted to put out as much Muppets content as possible that they legally are able to.They could put a few shows on. I liked the episode with John Cleese.It\\'s weird how much Disney doesn\\'t own in relation to The Muppets. I thought they owned Jim Henson, but apparently not. I think Disney owning half the catalog only complicates things. :(Sony has distribution rights for at least Muppets in space and take Manhattan so that\\'s why they aren\\'t on Disney+For those wondering: that\\'s why when you watch old SNL episodes on Hulu you don\\'t get performances from musical guests.Muppets Tonight was produced by Disney though.They (Sony) also made a direct-to-video Muppet movie in 2002 called Kermit’s Swamp Years, which was about Kermit’s childhood growing up in the swamp. I used to love that movie as a kid. Does anyone else here remember that movie?True! When the Muppet Show was released on VHS in the 90s it was in the form of a compilation of Muppets-only sketches... no guest star in sight.True, but for television broadcast. So the contracts with guest stars will have included agreements about rebroadcasting, but nothing about streaming. I am no lawyer, but I could imagine new contracts being needed to cover addition of Muppets Tonight on Disney+.Yeah I remember that one, had a DVD when I was younger and watched it all the timeOoooh, they may have some serious issues with Garth\\'s episodeWhy with that one in particular?Because he\\'s a very notorious artist in terms of strict copyright. The biggest selling solo artist in US history and he\\'s not on YouTube or any streaming sight, save his exclusive contract with AmazonI wasn’t aware of that! Then streaming that episode may be problematic indeed. Imagine the original Muppet Show then, where they have to deal with 120 guest stars and countless song covers.I remember it. For the most part it was \"recess in space\". But there\\'s some good episodes like when they had a transgender friend, or their friend thst reached adulthood in like 2 weeks.I feel like a number of early 2000s shows are missing for some reason.I forgot all about this show! But now that you mentioned it, I remember this was always on when I’d wake up in the middle of the night until I would fall back asleep lolIt was on awhile ago because I saw it after I watched Recess. Now I can\\'t find it.I remember coming home from school and watching it on Family ChannelDisney wants to forget most of their One Saturday Morning lineup unfortunately. There\\'s only like Doug and Recess.I forgot about this show! I loved watching it though.Well that’s sucks I was looking forward to news :(it\\'s fine, at least they have the webcast next week to make up for itFirst Bob Chapek, now coronavirus, and now thisUgh, so no more info on what\\'s at launch?!Webcast?i believe they are doing one :)like a conference call but with a videoSo they could reveal big information such as a trailer or casting? Basically like at E3 where you see it live?Once they minimize, you can move the cursor over to them and click and they should restore back to normalYou can click back on, I have just done it, I was so pissed, but all is ok.....phew!!!This is why I cancelled. No reason to not at least have an on-off setting for that- very disrespectful to their own content!If I highlight the minimized movie and click on it nothing happens. Both on my Amazon fire stick and on ps4.This works on the AppleTV versionBecause you liked Hannah Montana: The Cheetah Girls 1-3, Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen, Liv & Maddie, The Last Song, Cadet Kelly, Star Struck .Because you liked Descendants: Zenon 1-3, Wizards of Waverly Place, Invisible Sister, Life Size 1-2, Sky High.Because you liked BMW & GMW: Read It & Weep, Even Stevens, The Game Plan, The Parent Trap.I watched some of these already but binging again wouldn’t be bad. ill look into it thanks![removed]The music licensing rights will probably prevent them from ever adding it, but I hope they willNone of that jazz(no offence) they just don’t like the English language. Disney really think the whole entirety of Canada is Quebec, should of voted more to separate them from Canada tbh. I like English okay, I’m not racist, I just think trying to understand French is like trying to read a book that’s upside down while sky diving. They’re also a billion dollar company too lolDoubtful.  I expect it to be the same £5.99 per month.  As it’ll be billed monthly as part of you’re existing packaging you’re unlikely to benefit from the savings afforded by the annual plan available direct with Disney (£59.99 or the preorder promo of 49.99) vs almost £72 when payed month to monthI imagine it’ll be the same as the current deal. I know Netflix is slightly cheaper, but I’d be surprised if Disney goes that way.I bought it now as I\\'d rather pay it outright than add to my Sky bill. It\\'s high enough as it is lolSame issue.  Just tried to sign up, nothing but a spinner.  Probably just down for the moment...will try again later.Sorry, meant to put a bit of background to this too!I have tried mutliple PCs, different users and 3 different browsers including on my desktop PC, laptop and mobile.Anyone else having this trouble?Try an other browser or deviceIt\\'s not out yet here.Unfortunately mine has been doing this for a week now...Are you trying to sign up from work?  I realized i was trying here and it might be blocked.  Took my phone off wifi and was able to sign up in seconds.New year member here.That worked! My home wifi wouldn\\'t have it either weirdly.  Thanks!I sure hope so.  Already paid for the subscription after watching a YouTube video of “How to download Disney+ on Fire TV stick” in US.  So it will be a real bummer if for some reason in the UK it’s not available.🙄Well, I guess we have to rely on our consoles to watch Disney+I was banking on it, but it seems less likely with recents changes to the device list, which is a little rubbish as we’ve always had access to Disney Life in the Fire Stick.It has been removed from their compatibility list.https://help.disneyplus.com/csp?id=csp_article_content&sys_kb_id=92e7685d1bcfc8d4b8651f861a4bcb01https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/variety.com/2020/digital/news/the-mandalorian-to-premiere-on-german-free-tv-prosieben-disney-plus-amazon-fire-tv-1203520644/amp/Also this article. You can already download the app on other platforms but not on the firestick App Store.https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.t3.com/amp/news/disney-uk-confirmed-as-coming-to-amazon-fire-tv-and-tabletshttps://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.t3.com/amp/news/disney-uk-confirmed-as-coming-to-amazon-fire-tv-and-tabletsI guess so.All of my tv watching is done via firestick (Apple Tv+, Netflix, Amazon Prime and BBC iplayer) so hopefully they can sort out a deal.Ah, cheers for the good news!Same here, I suppose we could watch online on a PC but it’s not the same, hopefully Disney and Amazon will get it sortedNo problem!At least there will be a PS4/Xbox app.Good news!https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.t3.com/amp/news/disney-uk-confirmed-as-coming-to-amazon-fire-tv-and-tabletsBrilliant news! Thanks for the updateYou’re welcome!The lack of clarification, with only three weeks before the service finally launches, is a little frustrating. Especially as they are already selling subscriptions now. I’m pleased to see that at least The Simpson’s has now been confirmed, but having a firm idea of what the service will offer is a must at this point.Well there are 3 MCU movies I don’t think any of us will ever get: Incredible Hulk (Universal), Spider-Man Homecoming (Sony), Spider-Man Far From Home (Sony). Otherwise it will depend on previous agreements in the marketIt’s already a great price, but I’d expect their marketing to be highlighting more than just The Mandalorian and Infinity War. All 9, hopefully 12, Star Wars films in one price is pretty awesome, not to mention the MCU, It’s stuff like that that would drive subscriptions through the roof. Just a little bit of clarity.Apparently we don’t get Infinity War till end of this year according to a leakI wish they\\'d say which cartoons we\\'re getting.Hopefully we’ll get more concrete information out of Thursday’s launch event. Don’t think it’s being live-streamed but will be watching the DisneyPlusUK Twitter account closely in case they post a mega thread highlighting availability like they did for the US launchIn terms of MCU, Now TV has a couple with the following expiry dates.Iron Man-24th June 2020.IM2-24th June 2020.Thor-20th December 2020.Captain America-18th September 2020.Thor TDW-23rd June 2020.Age of Ultron-25th June 2020.Ant-Man and The Wasp-25th June 2020.Captian Marvel-31st Jan 2021.Infinity War-19th March 2020.Endgame-18th March 2021.In Terms of Star Wars on Now TV.1-6/clone wars movie-10th August 2020Solo-16th April 2020.Good news on The Simpson’s and The Mandalorion. Bad news on those MCU films under licence.That’d be strange considering they’re using Thanos to advertise the £50 deal.Not happening now apparently.That’s a lot more than a couple. :D I guess we’ll see if all of those are definitely exclusive following the latest deal that was just signed.Sorry would you be able to clarify what this is? Are these all on NowTV currently until the given expiry dates?I mean they are using Thanos pretty stupidly in their ad. The dude wanted to wipe out half of all life yet Disney only take £10 off the total year price. Bad marketing 101Ah.  Did wonder if it might. Makes senseAs far as I know from reading articles/ content lists. Disney and Sky have made a deal where both companies keep things, if this continues after the current deals expires I don\\'t know. The only MCU stuff missing from Plus should be the Hulk movies (universal owns them) and the Spider-Man movies (Sony owns them). Star Wars 1-6, clone wars movie, rouge one and solo will be on plus, Rise of Skywalker should be added later In the year.That’s a bit of a silly nitpick. No one using common sense would expect 50% off a year. He’s being used because the character is so well known at this point. And connected to my original point, presumably because you’ll be able to watch him at launch.Edit: I don’t care if I’m downvoted, expecting a £30 deal for a year just because Thanos is in the ad is a stretch of a complaint. I mean, £60 is already 2 months free, while £50 is nearly 4 months free. £30 would be like getting 12 months for the price of 5.There\\'s going to be an online announcement on Thurs still, so we\\'ll still get the list probably.It\\'s just the audience in the room that\\'s cancelled.I had my Firesticks set to the 5ghz wifi band up until a recent update, then it was garbage on the 5ghz band. Try the 2.4ghz wifi band if you are not already on it.The screen occasionally turns black it the middle of a movie or episode for me.I will check when i get home to see what its at thanksIf its not how do i switch itLook at your wifi connections under settings. If you have a dual band router you may have connected to the 5ghz band instead of the 2.4ghz band.For the US:**Movies*** *Miracle on 34th Street* (1947)* *Journey to the Center of the Earth* (1959)* *The Sound of Music* (1965)* *Rookie of the Year* (1993)* *Thumbelina* (1994)* *Home Alone 3* (1997)* *Never Been Kissed* (1999)* *Dr. Dolittle 2* (2001)* *Ice Age* (2002)* *Cheaper by the Dozen* (2003)* *Because of Winn-Dixie* (2005)* *Millions* (2005)* *The Simpsons Movie* (2007)* *Avatar* (2009)* *Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief* (2010)* *Diary of a Wimpy Kid* (2010)* *Ice Age: The Great Egg-Scapade* (short film) (2016)**Movies that were removed from the service in the US*** *Home Alone* (1990)* *Home Alone 2: Lost in New York* (1992)* *The Sandlot* (1993)* *Dr. Dolittle* (1998)* *Garfield: The Movie* (2004)* *Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties* (2006)* *Flicka* (2006)* *Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer* (2007)**Television*** *The Simpsons* (1989-)as well as loads of National Geographic contentUK will have more Fox content than the US, less contracts hereDoes the marvel cartoons that are part of Fox Kids that are on the service now count or no?Odd, it\\'s usually the opposite.Ik but hey I ain\\'t complaining, lolDid everyone just hear “wwwwuuuuaaaaah?!” in their head?It seems that only Boy Meets World is the only primetime ABC show on Disney+. I know BMW is on there because i binged it the first week. Wouldnt mind ripping through Home Improvement nextI have so many fond memories of Home Improvement, used to watch it with my dad as a kid. I saw my dad as Tim Taylor a lot of the times, and also my dad is pretty goofy and would say the same grunts as him too haha.It’s free on YouTube. You don’t need to pay anything for itI think the ABC stuff has weird streaming agreements, most of it is elsewhereI don\\'t think so Tim.I own every seasonI can pick up an antenna channel that shows reruns of old sitcoms. They would have a several hour block of Home Improvement and I got reacquainted with it last year. It really holds up. A lot of gags and jokes that still made me laugh.I’m buying the DVDs. I can’t keep waiting for it to arrive here, while shows leave streaming services at a whim.I absolutely love this show. I really hope we get it. Just last year when I was moving into a new space I just had my tv on the wall and just sat there and built this massive(really nice) desk and watched Home Improvement. That’s how you know you’re a real manIt’s all on YouTube.I think they are making a new show.i mean its on huluDoes not Hulu have this.NahNah, Tim Allen doesn\\'t deserve any fame or recognition.It\\'s on Hulu. No need to have it both places.I\\'ll be fine if it never shows up. I watched it as a teen, but this is definitely one that suffers with a modern lens, even more than Friends. And Tim Allen has turned out to be... not great. So that makes it hard to stomach, too.I hated that show then. I can\\'t imagine it\\'s aged well.Home Improvement has some great lessons about toxic masculinity for kids today.It\\'s on Hulu I don\\'t know if it\\'ll go to d+It\\'s on Hulu!I don\\'t think so. Tim.*Home Improvement noise*Oh. I guess I\\'m the only one that did this noise, out loud, as loud as possible.I absolutely did.Came to see if this would be best comment. Not disappointed.Now I did.What ya doing Wilson?!Yes...yes I did lolProbably because of Girl Meets World. I really hope we get more ABC content, especially the Wonderful World of Disney movies.[removed]They are only delaying this stuff to squeeze out the last potential DVD buyersIt\\'s on huluYouTube.They were gonna revive Home Improvement but Tim Allen got asked by Fox if he wanted to do a revival of Last Man Standing,that’s why the Home Improvement revival hasn’t happened yet. I still wonder though if when Last Man Standing is finally over for good and ended if Home Improvement will get a revival then.It used to until they removed itCare to elaborate?It’s been removed from Hulu,plus you can’t get Hulu here in Canada.Oh FFS. Stop.LmaoYeah? Like what?No it’s notYour not entirely wrong,they’ve just since removed the show.Also Boy Meets World was shown in syndication on Disney Channel and ABC FamilyWonderful World of Disney was a weekly tradition in our home as I\\'m sure it was in many homes. I mean, you don\\'t get much more Disney than that so what gives? I\\'m pretty surprised it\\'s not there and it was one of the first things I searched for and was disappointed to not find.[deleted]Not anymore. It left towards the end of November 2019. Luckily, I rushed and finished the series when I saw it was leaving, but this is exactly the reason I’m buying DVDs to begin with; No-one should be putting up with this sort of thing by streaming services. Streaming is not THAT great, not THAT convenient, and certainly isn’t the end all, be all of video products.But it\\'s not.YouTube doesn’t cut the mustard.I dunno if they could do it at this point: Wilson is dead, none of the kids want to act full time anymore, Debbe Dunning seems to have stopped acting altogether and the producers make hallmark movies now.It\\'s a shame, cause home improvement was a much better show than LMS. Less preachy, legitimately funnier.Last man standing was trash. He should have stuck with home improvementHe\\'s Bob Vila.My apologies. Idiot American here. Sometimes I forget that not everyone is talking about the US.Oh FFS that was the point of many of the scenes of the show. If you didn\\'t get that you were being taught about toxic masculinity and its pitfalls that\\'s on you.I see it\\'s not there anymore. I was watching it on Hulu a few months ago.I think it probably will show up on Disney then.I just found out lol . That sucks.I\\'m hoping that they\\'re working on adding them. There\\'s still a lot missing and I\\'m assuming that it will be added eventually. They\\'ve been really stingy with the ABC stuff so maybe that\\'s why. Probably trying to figure. out licensing and stuff.100% agree. I love getting my favorite shows on dvd so I can watch them whenever I want. I just got The King Of Queens complete series on dvd and it\\'s great! meanwhile you won\\'t find it on any streaming service.Wow, I think you\\'re the world\\'s biggest Home Improvement fan.Hmm. Was a couple months agoWhat\\'s wrong with YouTubeIt\\'s so weird to think that Taran Noah Smith is old enough to be divorced.  :|You aren’t an idiot,sometimes we forget. I don’t know you and I’m sure your a very smart person.Ok Karen.justwatch says directTV (AT&T) has it.It’s also streaming video, which doesn’t offer the same quality as physical media.There are people his age with grandchildren.Yeah, I\\'m a man who grew up watching this show. But I can tell you missed the message when you were watching it.It definitely wasn\\'t about ethics in gaming journalism.Damn. Just checked. That\\'s a shame. I had just watched it on there a couple months agoThis was probably released in what... 480p? And you\\'re worried about quality degradation from YouTube?Maybe I just enjoyed the show and didn\\'t get my panties in a wad.It’s worse on YouTube. YouTube is worse for everything. Streaming video isn’t all that, period.Do the world a favor and don\\'t procreate. The world has enough trumpets.Laughs in 4k remuxThey *are* in the right order. Chronological order is just different, not \"correct.\"The only episode of the series that actually aired out of order is \"Revival,\" because Dave Filoni believed it should be the season premiere. It is in the proper place in the Blu-ray and Disney Plus release.I believe the airing order is the intended way to watch it. The chronological order given is just an alternative way to watch it.They’re in the correct order for how it was meant.The chronological lists of the clone wars episodes make more sense. I don’t think watching them in release order is a better experienceNot  true there are cases where where a character dies in a episode then is a alive in the next so Chronological  is correct. not sure why eveyone likes the cartoon network order even tho  it causes issuesExactly. Like the films they are meant to be seen in release order.yea thats what I was saying to bad most people on here dont agree so Disney+ will never change the order but thanks for backing me up everyone was down voteing meI\\'m not saying that the episodes are chronological as aired, only that they aired intentionally.  The episodes begin with exposition explaining when the episode takes place.Even chronological order doesn\\'t follow the production code order.The films are absolutely meant to be seen in release order. Jumping in to TPM as a new fan would be super confusing and ANH is a perfect introduction. Not to mention watching the prequels first ruins the ESB reveal.To be clear, my opinion fwiwIt’s not like they are unenjoyable watched in the order they airedIt’s just better if they’re in chronological orderNot sure why anyone would think they need to defend their choice of order, saying it is “the correct order”It’s cool that you enjoyed it out of chronological order... and the way they aired. I’m not slamming anyone for liking it that way. I liked it that way too the first time I watched em.ExactlyI had this problem when watching any HDR content from D+ on my Amazon Fire 4k. I could usually watch one show, and then had to reboot the Fire stick or had the problem. Amazon replaced it, but had the same problem with the replacement. Switched to a non-4k Fire stick and the problem went away.Which device?Currently watching boy meets world with no problems hereYeah. It\\'s been happening to me. I have the firestick. Been a problem for like two weeks now. On Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, Elena of Avalor, and Doc Mcstuffins. And probably more shows if I didn\\'t watch more than one episode at a time. But I do watch more than one episode of those three shows at a time though. So I only mentioned those three.Disney does not own the distribution rights to Digimon. From what I remember, all of the seasons are on Starz now.Why would Digimon have anything to do with Disney? It\\'s made by Toei and Bandai.Definitely not.  Disney never wanted anything to do with Digimon in the first place.  Disney wanted the Fox Family channel in the early 2000s (which they renamed ABC Family and now Freeform).  \"Fox Kids\" shows like Digimon and Power Rangers ended up being part of the package deal.  Disney sold the rights to Saban Brands later on.  Saban gave up the rights after Digimon Fusion, and I believe they defaulted back to Toei Animation.No, they don\\'t own Digimon. It\\'s not Disney.However, they do indeed own a single Digimon movie, Digimon: The Movie, because of their purchase of 20th Century Fox which had distribution rights to it, therefore passing those distribution rights to Disney. So, that movie could indeed come to Disney+ some day.It’s possible Disney still owns the distribution rights to “Digimon: The Movie” since it’s a 20th century fox film, but even if they did I doubt they would put it on Disney+. They seem to be steering away from anime for this service.[deleted]Many people don\\'t understand the difference between the production companies, distribution companies, and broadcast partners.My assumption is that Digimon was on Fox, so it\\'s a Fox show, so Disney owns it.That, of course, falls apart twice - Disney does not own the Fox network, and 20th Television was not a distributor or producer of the series.disney dubbed season 5 and two of the movies, but they only licensed them for a few years, so if they did still have rights it would only be season 5 and those 2 moviesI don\\'t think they\\'re steering away from anime for this service, they just don\\'t really own much anime. And I don\\'t think Disney steers away from anime in general because they distributed Studio Ghibli movies in the US for a long while. They also make a ton of anime-esque Marvel shows that are really popular and have been put on Disney+.I could see Digimon: The Movie coming to Disney+ due to Disney now owning distribution rights to it, as you said. It\\'s not all too different from how they have the 20th Century Garfield movies and the Blue Sky Peanuts movie on Disney+ in some countries. They\\'re movies that are a part of a series/brand that\\'s owned by a different company, but they own distribution rights to these particular movies, so they\\'re putting them on Disney+. Digimon: The Movie is also a movie that\\'s a part of a series/brand that\\'s owned by a different company. So, I see no reason for them not to throw it on Disney+ some day. They need all the content they can get.Why?The rights have reverted back to Toei-Anime ages ago so it wont be on Disney+ even then the rights were owned by Saban Brands and not Disney.There’s also the fact that they have the broadcast rights to Pokémon in several different countries(Yes this includes the US)But then again, Disney owned Saban for a number of years before they suddenly gave it back to the original owners.In the U.S., it goes to HBO as part of the existing 20th Century studio output deal. In other countries, it may vary.Don\\'t buy a copy unless you are ready to be deeply disappointed in your decision. I went in with pretty low expectations and it was still not a great movie.For the UK maybe not for the US though due to HBOSeriously, just watch it on Season 2 of X-Men: The Animated Series instead.  Much, much better than any of the movies.I hope not.If you aren’t in the US, i would say some time within the next month or two.I had no idea about the existing deal with HBO. For a minute, I thought it was because the movie was so bad, not even Disney wanted it on there lolHaven\\'t seen it, but don\\'t see how it could be worst than Brett Ratner\\'s X3.Westworld season 3 starts soon, so I\\'ll watch Dark Phoenix when I subscribe for a couple of months.It is trust me, it’s probably the first movie ever that I have turned off.  While X3 is bad,  Dark Phoenix is bad and boring... nothing really happens... I was shocked at how bad it actually was.> Haven\\'t seen it, but don\\'t see how it could be worst than Brett Ratner\\'s X3.And yet everyone is saying it is.Just like how you don\\'t understand how someone could make an FF movie worse than Roger Corman did in a weekend for $1 million.  But Fox somehow managed to pull it off.Hard to bomb the Phoenix Saga twice but Fox did it spectacularly.This happened to me while watching The Simpsons on my firestick. I thought I was the only one lol.FinallyFrom your username and \"problem\" I can deduct that you are in Canada and haven\\'t searched this sub.I\\'m so glad they added a whole lot of classic Disney animated shorts featuring Mickey, Donald and Goofy. The one with Goofy learning to ski is absolutely hilariousThey did it for all android(ish) devices I guess.  Yesterday Shield TV got it too.Still working for you? Not working for me on Firestick 4KAny idea if the Chromecast or Sony Bravia now do ATMOS?Sorry, no idea.When you pause the movie, go to the top right corner. Once clicking it should give you the option to change audio and add subtitles. Switch back to English audioI tried that, but the only choice is ESPANOL. I do not see English.Its currently got its streaming rights with USA (owned by Universal/NBC). If you have cable you can stream it for free. This probably won\\'t be added to Disney+ til that contract expires.To the person who asked who Percy Jackson was: its a book series about the children of Greek gods that they turned into two films I believe.The Percy Jackson sequel is gonna be on Disney Plus sometime between March 15th - 21stOh ok thank you 😊They only made the first 2 books into movies. The books were so much better. The movies were so far off from the books that they failed. Rick Riordan himself basically disowned the movies; they were that bad. The Titan\\'s Curse and the others were never made b/c the others flopped that bad.Source?If you look at the Walt Disney Studios Facebook/Instagram page, they recently posted images of Disney Plus’ release schedule for March. Though now that I’m looking at it, I realize this may possibly be only for Canada.[Walt Disney Studios Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/96691146598/posts/10156678811541599/?d=n)Disney + posted it on social media todaySame on Pixel 3. Such a pain if you\\'re trying to download a whole season of somethingI hadn’t heard of this until you mentioned it! Right now it’s available on Disney Now. I’m not sure if they’re only making it available for that service specifically or not so that Disney Now isn’t completely abandoned or irrelevant.But I’m sure eventually it will get added to Disney+! Just have to be patient. I’m pretty sure Gravity Falls is on the service though.I kinda hope they get a move on with the Disney Channel stuff.I watched it on disney now before disney plus was a thing maybe try that. I don’t really understand the reason to have it anymore because they’re just gonna eventually move everything to disney plus in the feature but try watching it there?Fish hooks seasons 1-3 might be coming to Disney+ in April.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xenVBzVaSIY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xenVBzVaSIY)&#x200B;Edit: WILL BE COMING TO DISNEY PLUSTaika Waititi, Paul Bettany and Jeff Goldblum.With no Tom Selleck?!?!?!how many reboots can a company do?  and why?And then it will be moved to Hulu or have production paused/cancelled.I watched this movie a hundred times when I was a kid.Nick Offerman, Zach Effron, Jim ParsonsIs it still going to have the ghost kid in a scene?Out of all the properties they can choose to reboot...they chose this...Most people probably forgot about this movie.So portraying men as clueless when it comes to raising a child is still ok I guess?oh great, another reboot.... The original is amazing btw but its obvious the world is out of ideas loolWouldn\\'t it have been easier to just continue Baby Daddy? Which is, no doubt, based on Three Men and a Baby? It was on ABC Family/Freeform, so Disney already owns the rights. So, realistically, instead of rebooting something that hasn\\'t been seen in quite a while, why not just continue a show that ended 3 years ago, that is essentially the same exact story?i liked the sequel idea that i remember hearing before, 3 men and a bride. Danson can for sure still act, not sure about the other two.never heard of itThis is actually a great fancastIt should. That’s what makes repeat viewings of the original so funDidnt even realize ice age is disney nowSkip the scenes with the babyNow they just need to put the other 6...7 Ice age movies on there.ze babyI hope the rest of the Ice Age movies get on Disney Plus someday! My favorite Ice Age movie is Ice Age 3!DESTROY THE CHILD!Insert ice age babyKill the babyI literally almost rented it last night! HahaI think all of the Ice Age movies are in Canada already. I’ve only seen the first three. I liked them, but I haven’t seen 4 and 5. I didn’t hear any nice things about 4, but I heard 5 was absolutely atrocious.Fun fact, this movie began its life as a traditionally animated Don Bluth movie, and you can sorta still feel his influence on the script in Manny\\'s backstory and the other darker themes. After the catastrophic failure of Titan AE, FOX terminated their relationship with Bluth, who was only on the second of a five film contract, and retooled it as a CGI comedyNow i can find and kill the babyI\\'ve never seen it.Is Ice Age Baby in this movie? If so, then I\\'m not watching it. For moral reasons, I can\\'t support anything that Ice Age Baby is in.Hate this bland franchise with a passion.Do they have it in 4K?On my way... on my way... on my way... on my way...That seems so weirdI saw that the other night. I was not impressed with the movie when I saw it the first time, but it was popular and I hope there are people that enjoy it. At least enough to make it worth sticking in the server instead one of the many Disney original shows (\\\\*cough cough, Honey I Shrunk The Kids the series, cough cough\\\\*).I hope the baby diesWHERE is ice age 3? In the UK i can only see 1, 2 and 4???????... So you got three melons?GoodI already got it cuz I’m in Canada! We also got all the fox marvel movies as wellI thought that was a dream works movieI’m sorry what?[deleted]*Baby Adam DriverIn the Netherlands we have the other 6 Ice Ages movies on Disney+ as wellIf they will add another ice age film in the future. They will probably add continental drift nextI\\'m guessing you\\'re including the Christmas and Easter specials too, well the Easter special is already on thereIt will by 2022My favorite is The MeltdownYes pleaseNiceSaw all of them already there amazing and rewatch ableI wish i could of seen that versionI totally understandWdym?only collision course is in 4K and that’s only available outside of the US unfortunatelyIdk 😐 I don’t think willLol look at the screenshotIf they make a next ice age movie they need to make the baby DIEShould be coming soon, I currently don’t live in the uk but the latest time for the series would be 2022If you weren\\'t smart enough to plan ahead, then DOOM ON YOU!Your so lucky!Blue skys is owned by 21st Century which is owned by Disney?Ice Age is owned by Blue Sky, who are owned by Fox, who are owned by Disney.Blue Sky Studios were part of Fox.I can\\'t unsee it.No, don’t lump Adam driver with that horrid baby.

I try and try but I still don’t see it.I mean, you are the great white North so...I only consider the first one as a classic, I don’t really like the sequels.Ice Age is kinda like the Despicable Me franchise, the first one was average and then everything after declines, the only exception being 3 because of BuckClassic as in good and still holds up or classic as in you saw it at a monumental time in your life and have nostalgia for it? Because it really is not a high quality film.Each to their own.also x-menAnd diary of a wimpy kid🤔 Wonder howTrue3 was good tho. I don’t remember 2 that much. The rest are complete garbage cash grabs tho.I think the first one is the best, but I can\\'t hate the fourth one because Peter Dinklage is absolute perfection. Never bothered to see the fifth oneI don’t see any of the movies on thereBecause they own it...love them scrat shorts though. the most modern incarnation of wile e. coyoteThe TV shows are on therei have them in australiaCanada has them.Well no duh. I just wonder why only specific content is on Disney +...If they put everything they own on one platform they actually lose money on all other platforms. People will only have Disney+ over buying the movies/shows and streaming them on other apps.KkOn one hand, their original programs is the driving force for people to subscribe. If people know that they can get that show on home video a year after it aired without subscribing, they’ll do that instead.On the other hand, they know Star Wars and Marvel fans will buy anything (provided that the product has quality), and many people don’t buy physical media as they used to. People will pay $6 a month to watch a show over paying $20 for a Blu-ray. While I don’t think you’ll see The World According to Jeff Goldblum or High School Musical: The Series on Blu-ray, it be shocked if Disney didn’t release the Mandalorian or any Marvel show on home video.nobody can answer thisProbably not. Netflix and Prime do not do it.Yeah, I get what you\\'re saying, thank you very much, I do appreciate it your helpTrue, trueNetflix does. I got Stranger Things 1 & 2 on 4K DVDSome do. Netflix “exclusives” like House of Cards, Orange is the New Black and Lost in Space are available on digital and/or disc. Also some Hulu originals like Castle Rock and Handmaid’s Tale. It’s probably a negotiating point when the streamer is negotiating with a show’s creators / producers. The show runners may be willing to take less money from the streamer if they retain rights to sell thru disc and digital. Disney has not commented on its shows. I could see it going either way. If they do release for purchase, it will probably be at least a year after original broadcast. The $7 monthly fee for D+ is so low that I don’t think many people will skip a subscription to purchase. But some collectors and completists will happily pay to have a copy in their collection. Selling full seasons could prove to be an additional revenue stream that doesn’t really cost them any D+ subscriptions.Okay, thank youI stand corrected.Netflix also released House of Cards on disc.How many season of those shows? I only saw the first season of those shows.My thinking is, it kind of defeats the purpose of having subscribers.  I know Netflix years ago did release the first season of some shows, and only the first season. I don’t even think they do that anymore.netflix didn\\'t do that but yeah it is on dvd,bluray ,other streaming services and tv channelsWith the possible exception of the most recent season (which is usually delayed 6-12 months), all are available on iTunes.Yeah, that is what I was wondering, well thank you very much anyways for your help, do appreciate itAll of House of Cards is on Blu-ray.I never looked on iTunes. Still the OP was looking for DVD/Bluray. Those I haven’t seen in ages.Recess the show is on there. At least in the US.First three seasons are on disney+ dude. Depends on your region though. The US currently has half the showThere were only three seasons of Recess and all 65 episodes are on Disney+.When the hell did they add that?Ah, I see my confusion. Seasons have been listed to not account for the fact that every episode aired in pairs. Disney+ just has them out of order......... again 😤Thank for the heads up. Genuinely appreciate itIt was available on launchNovember. Launch dayWrinkle in Time was disappointingMost of this was already available in the Netherlands... which probably means that there won’t be many additions for us this month.Hopefully Disney takes this opportunity to give us some content that has been available in other markets since launch, such as The Rescuers, TaleSpin, Doug, Teacher’s Pet, Lizzie McGuire, Hercules series, Emperor’s New School, My Dog the Thief, Mickey Mouse Club, and Wonderful World of Disney. But I am not holding my breath...so weird that Ice Age is Disney nowI need Dog With A Blog on there soonMediocreAh, the ever confusing Stargirl.Neat detail at about 1:30 in the video.I used to work in that area and saw some weird acrobatics stuff going on over a wall walking to and from work.  I never could figure out what was going on there, but it looks like Disney is ready to show it off.Also, the big yellow building and bell tower you can see in the background in that shot is th Dreamworks Animation campus.  Not sure Disney meant to show the competition, but I guess that’s what happens when you’re neighbours.Wait. Black Panther is only getting added now? Wtf lol.Its not even disneys first attempt eitherI also love that show. I did look and it is under Disney. So it can come any month now.Didn’t they show the acrobatics stiff at the last episode of imagineering story? I think it’s aomething for spider man maybe...Disney has shown this off for some time. It is called a stunttronic. It will be used as spiderman in the Avengers Campus opening later this year in California Adventure.It was still on netflixYes, there has been some footage of this show already.  I was just thinking about when I was working in that area some years ago, well before any public announcements.Rewind to me, about 5 years ago walking to the bus stop on San Fernando Blvd.  I saw some acrobatics over the wall of that building and thought “Neat! Those are some talented trapeze artists.  I wonder what show they are developing.”  I had no idea what it really was at the time.You can add the Rogers and Hammerstein Cinderella (with Whoopi as fairy godmother), Geppetto (Jim Carey), and Music Man (Matthew Broderick) to this list of missing musicalsThanks! I had completely forgotten about Music Man and Cinderella and I didn’t even know about Gepetto! Gepetto looks incredibly hysterical!By the way, Geppetto was Drew Carey, not Jim Carrey.No, I don\\'t think Disney owns it.  There are a few series and movies on Netflix.They\\'d have to legally contract with the owners and secure streaming rights, which is unlikely, but  theoretically, yes.Not sure why they would be legally able to.This is an odd question.  They\\'d only be able to do that if they had a contract to do so, so . . . no?  Aside from things they own but choose not to have on there (*Song of the South*, mature stuff, etc.), I doubt they have things they\\'ve contracted for that they\\'re choosing not to use.If they have the rights or buy the rights yeah but I think there are seasons on Netflix and they can’t have it at the same time as netflixNo, they don\\'t own Pokemon. It\\'s not Disney.Might have answered this before but the Pokémon Company has their own personal free to use Streaming Service called Pokémon TV. I believe it’s an App you can get on your smart phone or smart tv device.It only covers about a third of the series at a time as they rotate, but it’s free and legal.Disney would most likely not put Pokémon on Disney+, as they don’t own it, and most of the anime they license is placed on Hulu. I believe you can watch a portion of Pokémon on Hulu as well.Doesn\\'t Cartoon Network usually do Pokemon?Legally? Of course. Not likely to happen given what Disney+ actually is for.Disney+ is for all Disney branded and owned content that they can either minimize or eliminate the cost to them entirely for hosting said content.Pokemon is owned by the pokemon company and by extension Nintendo. It is far more likely that either warner media with At&t owning Crunchyroll or Netflix which has multiple Japanese partnerships would get the contract to stream pokemonDidn’t know Disney owned Pokémon. They dont, and they would have to do contract stuff for streaming rights. Like dont think that would work maybe if we pushed it but, knowing Disney i don’t think we’ll ever get it.They make the English dub.The question probably came up because of the relationship Disney XD has had with Pokemon, where they have had all the seasons of the show and several movies at a time up for streaming on Watch Disney and currently on DisneyNow. They\\'ve been doing this for years.They use to, but decided not to renew their contract with the pokemon company and Disney picked up the broadcasting rights.Im fairly sure Pokemon Company does the English dub currently and 4Kids did before that.No they don\\'t. They have the license to air it on their network, but they had no part in making it. The dub is done by the same company that\\'s been doing it for over a decade, ever since 4Kids gave it up.Wasn\\'t aware of that.  Thanks!No problem\\\\How can they remove The Sandlot where they are going to add the sequels this month? That doesn\\'t make sense.Why would they remove anything! :(I hate being left in the dark about titles leaving the serviceHopefully the reason I Captured the King of the Leprechauns was removed is that they need to make some technical adjustments so that it can be offered in other regions as well!We lost Pete’s Dragon (1977) for a few days last week, but it was returned soon.which dumbo the original or the remakeokay the sandlot is embarrassing. How dare they announce last month that it was a returning title and then take it off again. you can\\'t keep acting like you\\'re adding content to the service and then just remove it. because if that\\'s the case then every other month you just keep saying returning title and people get excited but in reality it\\'s like you\\'re just giving us the same movies back and forth 😂Ugh.  They shouldn\\'t let anything leave.Alice in wonderland the 2010 version has been removedWhy did they remove The Sandlot again?And they take it off prior to baseball season. D\\'oh!Unfortunately it usually means they are heading back over to Starz.They did the same with Garfield and Doctor Dolittle. It doesn\\'t make senseWell. At least for Home Alone. It\\'s assumed that they threw the movies up there to advertise them with Disney Plus around the holidays regardless of any existing distribution limitations. Some of the fox owned properties have different digital distribution deals, similar to the MCU movies that aren\\'t currently available on Disney Plus. So instead of not including them. They threw all the fox properties up there to sell the subscription, then take them down if those who own the rights to distribution say anything, which is why Home Alone was removed less than two months after it was added. Does this help?I think it is the originalWhat region? Still available for me in the USIt was up for like what two weeks this time? Glad I watched it again and thankfully baseball is about to start.well not every disney movie is promoted up front, i know some of the 2000\\'s films have to be searched for on disney+, but at least dumbo is still there regardless, though hopefully the sandlots removal is for a few days like it was for sword in the stoneIn AUSDumbo was also removed from the Disney Through the Years collectionNot all movies are promoted, but every single movie is available in the full listing (like the A-Z one).Dumbo is the exception. You can\\'t find it at all on the app unless you search for it.I am sure its just a little glitch, hopefully they fix it soon, at least you can search for the movie and still watch it. as long as dumbo remains untouched, the film itself, I don\\'t like censorship, it will all be okay, I sometimes check the movie itself to see if it always was left alone, and it has been, I mean the crows obviously.[deleted]If you’re logged in on your phone, you can login to your tv without having to follow a qrcode/link/etc. You simply open the app and allow the account to be added to the tv.It\\'s because they are on the same wifi network.[deleted]I get that. I\\'m trying to understand the tech /protocols used to do thisAll smart TV, like fireTV. Spotify does the same thingI’m going to say no. The reason being that these films were Miramax films and Disney sold that studio awhile ago. I think ViacomCBS now owns a stake in it, so if the Bionicle movies show up to stream anywhere it’ll either be on the new updated CBS All access streaming service, or Netflix.No, they don\\'t own Bionicle or the Bionicle movies. They aren\\'t Disney. They\\'re Miramax. Disney actually used to own Miramax back in the day, but they don\\'t anymore and haven\\'t for a long while. So, yeah, they aren\\'t Disney movies or owned by Disney, so no, they won\\'t ever be available on Disney+.I\\'d be surprised if Lego didn\\'t have an ownership stake in that as well.I think they do. I meant ViacomCBS owns a stake in Miramax. I think it would fit better with ViacomCBS anyway, since they have the transformers brand, and power rangers to build off of and a lot of other hasbro toy properties.Disney+ comes to Eastern Europe between October this year and October 2021.Here’s a link: [Cnet](https://www.cnet.com/news/disney-plus-streaming-service-everything-to-know-global-release-dates/) You have to scroll down a bit :)Wow... the US is getting additions almost daily now! All we got in the Netherlands this week was Shop Class... it would almost be funny if it wasn’t so depressing.I still dont have season, im from the NetherlandsIt boggles my mind that this show gets so much hate. I see so many people in the fanbase crap on it because \"it\\'s ugly\" and \"it\\'s kiddy\" and then they turn around and talk about how Dave Filoni needs to take over Star Wars because Clone Wars and Rebels are so good.Clone Wars and Rebels are just as kiddy and a hell of a lot uglier than this show, AND this show was created by Filoni just like the other two.Is this show any good? CuriousToo bad no one cares...This was added like 5 days go wtf you’re lateclone wars and rebels started out more kiddy. by the second season of both shows they waded you into an uncomfortable pool of mayhem. at this point I\\'m just as inclined to give everything Dave Filoni does 2 seasons to start getting good as a general rule. The reverse joss whedon, if you will.I haven\\'t seen the second season of this show yet but Clone Wars and Rebels have rarely been as juvenile as almost the entirety of the first season of Resistance. It\\'s not a bad thing it\\'s less mature than Filioni\\'s other shows it\\'s just aimed at a slightly younger audience than Clone Wars or Rebels.I really wanted to like this series but the story just wasn\\'t there.  I got tired of the whole they arrive at some system, the NO finds them, their fighter pilots buy them time to escape, everyone jumps away just in time to escape.  Rinse and repeat.  I did like the alternate view from the Empire\\'s side.It\\'s fine, the show get stronger as it goes on but it never reaches the highs that Clone Wars or Rebels reach. The show itself looks great, the art style worked really well for the ships and planets. The main character Kaz is really only competent when he is in his ship. I\\'ve seen the entire show, and I wish it had a third season or a few more episodes so that it could tie into episode 9.I watched the entire series and didn\\'t care for it because a majority of the episodes followed the same pattern.Its not as good as clone wars or rebels imo. I\\'ve only seen the 1st season and half of the second though.Emmy award nominated series that’s won a Saturn award for best animated show. So yeah, it’s damn good.Haven’t watched it yetNoIMO its on-par with Rebels; both had strong and weak episodes.  I wished it had a bit more tie-ins with the films and maybe flesh out the history of the First Order versus the Republic/Resistance more; IMO its more of a side story during the ST era.So you’ve seen most of the show. It’s only 2 seasons and won’t have a 3rd. I feel your opinion is very valid since you’ve seen 75% of itwhere does resistance take place? between the prequels and the original trilogy?No it isn\\'t. The series has so many episodes about where the main character basically just has jar jar moments that turn into someone coming to the rescue or he has plot armour save the day. The characters have nothing to do with any real conflict and the only reason it couldn\\'t be any other scifi is they crammed BB8 into the random protagonists possession. It\\'s low effort plot to build tension just seemed inconsequential and far to dull for star wars. It\\'s like a slice of life anime dream was forced through a disney septic tank.I think rebels started weak but then got really strong later. I hope the rumors of a new series are true. Resistance never got past \"ok\" for me which is why I havent been in a rush to finish it.Well yeah, I\\'m not really expecting it to have some amazing ending that totally changes my mind on it:)Rebels is the one between the prequels and the original trilogy. Resistance is before and during the sequel trilogy.Resistance starts 6 months before Episode 7 and ends between Episodes 8 and 9.Nay. I’m 29, I hate the prequels but I love Resistance. It’s very well made and again highly acclaimed.[removed]It’s 40 episodes. It ended because the show runners wanted it to end. That’s how it works. Not every show is made to have 10 seasons.We all wanted it to end.“We all”. Kid when you grow up you will realize people have different opinions than you. There is a reason the show is so highly acclaimed, it’s because it’s good. What’s next? Mandalorian sucked? Just move along.Born in 86 bud and just not sold on this one. Critics and awards aren\\'t above shilling. Look at Batman the animated series or Samurai Jack, those were great and worthy of acclaim. There is something in Resistance, doesn\\'t feel like real heart though. Rebels feels like real heart. Rebels feels like something with gravity and connection, a nod to the past with a moving cast. That was a great way to show fans they can make something that will stand. I mean Clone Wars series has set a precedent.I wanted to like resistance but like you said, there is other opinions out there. I shouldn\\'t be surprised to hear them. Sorry to act the heel.Resistance and Mandalorian are “slice of life” shows. We take a break from all of that repetitive Jedi vs Sith drama to see how normal people are living in the galaxy. Both are done extremely well are that’s why they are highly acclaimed. The characters are extremely relatable and both the humor and the tension and stakes are done very well.One of my favorites!  Why do we even have that lever?This needs to be addressed ASAPAnd what exactly do you expect Reddit users to do to help you out? What did Disney say when you contacted them about the issue? &#x200B;>About /r/DisneyPlus  >  >This is a fan-run community is in no way authorized, sponsored or endorsed by Disney+ or the Walt Disney Company or any of its affiliates or subsidiaries.I\\'ve had that happen too when I was watching the Lion King (1994), and the title appeared in French while the rest of the movie was in EnglishThis is a known issue and cannot be solved by reddit.Came here to say this but not only the title sequences but the actual dialog, and all D+ has to say is this is an ongoing issueMulti-national, billion dollar entertainment company and you\\'re telling me they can\\'t just add a dropdown language select option for Canadian (English) and Canadian (French) to fix this language/region content glitch? That\\'s rich...Its unclear in my post, but my audio is also in french. This seems like such a simple fixThe back end team sent me this last night \"Hello,   We are reaching out from Disney Plus Support because of an open case regarding the opening crawl or audio in French. We apologize for the inconvenience over this rather strange issue. If you no longer see this happening, please disregard this email.    This issue is due to the movie version previously released in some areas. For some reason, certain places in Canada are restricted to the version with the French opening crawl (or the words on a sign in some Disney movies, etc.). We are aware of the issue and working on a solution, but I’m afraid I don’t have a timeline for this. I appreciate your patience on this matter though, and thank you for bringing this to our attention.

I dressed up as him for Halloween like 3 times when I was a kid. I still song the theme song. I\\'d love to see them on Disney+, too.I had a Wuzzles lunchbox that was my prize possession as a kid.  My mom stored it (along with other pots and pans) in the oven.  One of my babysitters didn’t realize it, preheated the oven without looking inside, and sure enough my Wuzzles lunchbox soon became a giant plastic mess.  I refused to let my parents ever call her again to babysit us.  I thought she had officially ruined my childhood.Oh man, I second thisI grew up without cable until I was maybe 9, so I had no idea this was a thing when I was little until one of my friends brought her vintage wuzzles sleeping bag to our sleepover when I was a kid. I thought they were so cute, lol.Oh my god. Not again. This is another show I forgot existed in my childhood. I had one episode recorded on the vhs cassette. this is so strangeBring back Bumble-lion, you cowards!The Wuzzles is a huge part of Disney history, too. It was the very first animated series they ever created.It was released on CBS in the same time slot as Gummi Bears on NBC. The idea was they\\'d see which one got better ratings, and cancel the other one. Unfortunately, despite far heavier advertising and merchandising campaigns for the Wuzzles, they lost.Point being: It would be really great if Disney gave it another chance on Disney+. It\\'s such a unique idea for a show that it\\'s a shame it\\'s so forgotten.Holy crud. We had stuff animals of these growing up. I never really knew what they were from.Two times the fun wrapped up and rolled... into one!I completely forgot I knew this was a thing. I definitely had a wuzzles puzzle as a kid. I think it was double sided. That or I had two of them lol.Here in the Land of Wuz they\\'re havin\\' twice the fun\\'Cause every single thing is really two in oneA little bit of this, a little bit of thatAnd when you add it up, you get a lot o\\' laughsOoh, they got originalityDriven with a split personality(We\\'re the Wuzzles!) Ooooh Yeaaah! ..Still haven\\'t forgotten the intro to this song! My cousins and I would pretend to be characters and I remembered I was Bumblelion and my sister was Butterbear. Can\\'t wait for this to be on Disney+. At least we got all the episodes of Gummi Bears.Oh my goodness I forgot about thisI had a Bumblelion when I was a kid! Loved this show. I even had a read along book and tape set. Hadn’t thought about that in years!This!!GUMMI BEARS WHEN?Why not just request it on the Disney plus help page in hopes that they will add in the future?Heres the steps on how to do so:1.https://help.disneyplus.com/csp2.Click where It says feedback 3.Select the option where it says request a film/show4.Enter the show/film that you would like to be added on Disney+I\\'m sure they are working on it.  The smaller shows probably have not been remastered so maybe they\\'re waiting?Same with the early 2000s shows they\\'re missing and Aladdin animated series.I’m team Rhinokey all the waySounds like she officially ruined the oven, too.The idea of combining animals like that is very simple and childlike. It connected with me. I also loved Gummy Bears because, well, it was awesome. Two great shows. Both should have continued.That doesn\\'t apply to some shows and I\\'d rather keep the original faded stock than have a cropped widescreen \"remaster\".If I remember correctly, it mostly melted onto the other pans it was sitting on top of and the oven was saved.  I’ll have go back and ask my mom what the official fallout was.Disney poured a ton of money into both shows, which is why the quality on both is astounding for the time. They got into TV animation without realizing everyone else was sacrificing quality for the sake of making more money off the merchandise.Unfortunately, that also meant that they couldn\\'t fund both projects for longer than a season. They expected The Wuzzles to be the runaway hit, so they focused more on merch for that than Gummi Bears. And then it wasn\\'t. So now they had even less money to move forward.Of course, they followed that up with DuckTales and that was a phenomenal success, both in ratings and in merch.I\\'m not talking about a widescreen crop(which I always loathe). Just a digital cleanup.Ducktails has one of the best theme songs of any TV show ever made. This podcast, Strong Songs, has an episode where he goes into cartoon theme songs and he covers Ducktails. The extended version has this amazing sax solo.I guess so. Though I\\'d rather Disney+ gave the US shows to the UK and other areas. Why don\\'t we get Emperor\\'s New School or Hercules?I have been having problems with the downloads too. Usually my downloads get to about 95 percent and then it\\'ll say I can only remove or dismiss. I know it\\'s not exactly the same problem, but I think downloads are glichy.Yeah when Disney+ first came out i was having problems having multiple things downloaded for space when i have the max iphones storage and iCloud storage and only had 3 shows downloaded at the time. I just waited a month or until they did the bug fixes update and it fixed the problem. As for that maybe they deleted them because you didn’t watch them and they have time stamps for how long they can be downloaded before you have to redownload it again. Maybe they’re doing it to clean space so you can download more things in the feature? Never heard of this problem but could be a reason.From what I was able to find looking through the app, some of the Marvel One-Shots look be in the \"Extras\" tab for some of the movies. I know for sure when I looked through Thor\\'s Extras, it had The Consultant in there. and in Iron Man 3\\'s Extras, there\\'s Agent Carter.And although it’s not technically part of the One Shots series you can find Team Thor: Part 2 in the extras of Doctor StrangeIt\\'s weird to me that the One Shots aren\\'t their own separate shorts when the DVD Pixar shorts like Mike\\'s New Car are.o issues here. Watched 4+ hours of Boy Meets World last night.Create a new account.Same thing happened me. The live chat couldn’t offer me any help as to who to contact about this minor block, her answer was -  “Look, Disney has many platforms, you might\\'ve added your email address somewhere before, that\\'s why there\\'s the block, which I cannot change, only can solve it with the mentioned process”.I’d like to know why though? I’ve made a new account, but it’s frustrating!It’s currently on HBO.I was just talking about this movie a couple weeks ago. I’d love to see if it holds upIt never made it to Blu-ray but I saw it in its dvd release and remember thinking it was still really cool. Oddly enough with everything they can do wjth CGI now I was really blown away by the real animalsI added The Mandalorian to my watchlist before it’s release, it added the first episode instead of the series, which I initial thought was odd.  Now I cannot remove the first episode from my watchlist.  If I click on the episode I get taken to The Mandalorian main page and if I add or remove it just adds or removes the series from my watchlist.  If I click the episode from the main series page it just auto plays. I’m on iOS and tvOS.This is the way.Can you remove it using the website?Website does the same thing, adds and removes the series, but other remainsThis really bothers me.  I mostly want the older content like Wonderful World of Disney and I was waiting for this one all month.  Then, we get it for 2 days and it\\'s gone with no explanation.  There are so many great Disney shows and movies on Amazon that are available for rent that could easily be put on Disney plus.  I don\\'t understand if they can put Hacksaw on there in standard definition, what\\'s keeping them from putting everything older on Disney Plus now.  And leave it there, like Bob Iger said.Yes, they did.I live in the Netherlands and Pete’s Dragon (1977) suddenly got pulled here last week, was gone for a few days, and then returned. Probably some technical issue had to be fixed.‘I Captured the King of the Leprechauns’ was not made available here. I hope that the reason it was pulled on your end is that they are making it available for additional markets.They\\'re probably just fixing the fact that it had some glitches.  When it first came out you couldn\\'t find it by searching for the title, and it didn\\'t pop up on the new on D+ section either... The only way I could find it was too browse through the decades.  Hopefully it\\'s only gone while they fix the problem.Anyone?Same issue, also seems to not be 4k. Thiz service sucksNo clue when the first will return. It does not appear to be streaming anywhere since it left so maybe it was removed for another reason like White Wilderness, Rise of the Silver Surfer, or Strange Magic. (People have said some of these are streaming on Starz but that\\'s not true - the lineup can be viewed by simply going here -  [https://www.starz.com/us/en/movies](https://www.starz.com/us/en/movies) )Dang, now I beat you by 2 hours!wow. so maybe it doesn\\'t show people when a new thing is posted in real-time cuz I looked at the new tab before I posted and no one had posted it yet.  but I guess you and I are the nocturnal ones that will be racingI found a fix that worked for me, and that was to sign out and in, hopefully that helps. :PHave you unplugged it and put it back in? Sometimes that helps.It’s been happening to us for couple months now.. started randomly one dayHave you ever tried a different browser? I had the same problem (from Germany) at the preorder. Edge and Firefox had this problem. With Chrome, it worked. I also use Chrome very rarely I have no adblock addons installed there.It’s possible. I mean of course the Fox animations such as for children are more likely I mean America already has Ice Age while Canada has the Peanuts movie. But in terms of the adult cartoons, that’s really hard to determine. While Family Guy and American Dad already look as if they’re never going to be on the service, shows like Bob’s Burger and Futurama have a better chance as they’re not as adult.It doesn’t hurt to try and request them on Disney+ the more content we get the better.Doubtful.I think most of that stuff would be a great addition to HULU.I was talking about the cartoon series that has never seen the light of day outside of the vault. I\\'ve been dying to see the 1969 Hardy Boys cartoon on D+, as that hasn\\'t been reran since 1971.For Fox Kids, yeah, it\\'s doubtful and he said \"DISNEY-OWNED\" Fox Kids cartoons, but they only cared for the Marvel Fox Kids cartoons. Don\\'t know about Fox\\'s non-Simpsons vintage cartoon catalog. Anything can happen. That\\'s for sure.These are obscure children\\'s cartoons, not their well known adult animated series.Also having the same issue.Weird. I don’t even see French as a language optionJust gone done talking with support, he told me to change all my profiles language setting to English UK. But that didnt work, so I\\'m waiting for them to get back to me now that it\\'s been escalated to tech support.  When Disney+ launched the opening crawl was in French, but now it\\'s the entire movies audio as well. In Canada on android atleast. The person on the help chat said this was a common issue, but had fix was just switching audio, and making sure to select the title from search. Maybe try that. But ya. Basically same issue.Just with A New Hope?didn\\'t work for me either. so much for my star wars marathon :( but thanks for reporting itMy brother doesn’t think they’ll put it on Hulu because the show is so strongly associated with Disney Channel they don’t want it to be PG13 no matter where it airs. Hope he’s wrong but damn I’m so bummedThe whole Lizzie thing is so odd. There are violent Halloween episodes of The Simpsons, as well as episodes with drug use, alcohol use (obviously), and sexual content.Just air the Lizzie reboot and rate it accordinglyI don’t know much about the ratings in the US, but can’t the show be rated PG-13 and stay on Disney+?In Norway there are plenty of Hollywood movies with low ratings that are not meant to be watched by children. It won’t hurt them to watch those movies, but they’re not the targeted audience. Can’t Disney+ do the same with the Lizzie McGuire reboot?I think Disney plus should just get adult content to be honest. Strictly PG13 and under holds back the service so much.They need to slap a parental lock feature on the service and streamline everything they have into it or else they will never truly be in the upper echelon of contenders. And I say this as a major Disney nerdI refuse to pay for Hulu.  But the show needs Terri Minsky.Honestly reaching out here won\\'t help. YouTube, Twitter, and MOSTLY [help.disneyplus.com/](https://help.disneyplus.com/) give feedback. That is what goes to them directly. I do not want Lizzie to move to Hulu. I want it to remain with the original on Disney Plus. But I want them to respect their subscribers and allow more mature content which means allowing Terri to return and see her vision through. They could have A) a warning before the episodes that it\\'s rated TV-MA or something. and B) add a passcode to the kid profiles that has to be entered before switching to an adult account.These two things would fix everything. They know that, too.The real issue is Disney. Just. Won\\'T. Do. It. It\\'s well documented they have to forced kicking and screaming to let loose. It\\'s like they\\'re run by the  Parents Television Council. The best hope is for Hulu to crash hard and for them to merge the two down the road but this likely is 10 years off as they plan to globally launch Hulu in 2022 and if that fails, they\\'d let that die before they\\'d let this die.They really should just add r rated content. They should\\'ve named the service something else because ATM it\\'s so limited and restricted...This is why Disney+ will never be a true challenger to Netflix and others. Netflix offers a bunch of content for every age group, from hard G to hard R. Disney moving the Love, Simon spin-off because the main character is gay and the Lizzie revival because it was intended for the group who actually watched Lizzie disappoints me so much as a supporter of this platform. They need to grow up and realize that only offering content for young kids and Star Wars/Marvel fans isn’t going to cut it. Clone Wars and Simpsons are far more adult then the shows they’re nervous about and yet they get prime advertising. Makes no sense.I must have missed something. When did Disney decide to reboot Lizzie McGuire? What is the controversy?IIRC (which may be completely false because I barely remember anything about the movie) Avatar has an f bomb in itThe Mandalorian has a guy being cut in half in the first episode. I have a feeling this had a lot more to do with the show being an obvious flop than it has to do with adult themes.[deleted]Lizzie McGuire is hotHonestly I am kind of suspicious of this whole thing and wonder if it\\'s a Hilary Duff issue. Does anyone remember her Bonnie and Clyde remake drama where she started a feud with Faye Dunaway and ended up dropping out of the whole project anyways? It seems really weird Disney would start making the show and suddenly realize it\\'s getting too edgy. I\\'m okay with a sanitized Lizzie McGuire series... we have a lot of shows about young women living in the city and you can even watch Younger on TV Land (also available on Hulu!) if you want to see one with Hilary Duff. I was kind of guessing the Lizzie McGuire reboot would be more of an \"adult with boring life finding joys of inner childhood\" thing. If anything, I wonder if Hilary tried to get it to be more edgy and Disney wondered why anyone would really need that. We already saw Lizzie get mistaken for a pop princess in Italy, no need for her life to get realistic on us.Reboot it on HBO please.I think there\\'s a difference between cartoon standards and live action standards since one can very obviously not be taken literally/seriously It\\'s still weird thoughOne of the more recent Treehouse of Horror has Homer have a threesome with two demons. I\\'m sure whatever Lizzie is getting up to isn\\'t that scandalous.Not to mention Homer freakin strangles Bart in practically every episode.I just watched the episode the other day that starts and ends with little Homer spermsLets be honest: The Simpsons on Disney+ was nothing more than a way to entice people to the service. If Family Guy was the cultural icon that The Simpsons was, then they would probably have that on the service instead and advertise Brian Griffin as one of their hot new IPs like they do with Bart.Yeah exactly. What are they going to do about the movie that has a scene of cartoon nudityI assumed that they would have shows that would be rated TV-14, the equivalent of a PG-13 rating for a tv show, but apparently that’s not happening? I’m not sure why that’s the case to be perfectly honest, and that’s the big head scratcher. It’s not as if it would be rated TV-MA, the equivalent of an R rating. For some reason Disney just doesn’t want to have shows with the TV-14 rating on their service and are moving them to Hulu or just completely redirecting the show content.The real confusing part is that there are PG-13 movies on the service and they’re quite violent at times. So I’m not sure what the line of thinking here is.Disney needs to let go of the \"younger audience\" content.If they made Hulu and Disney+ accessible from the same app that would be something at least. Let users decide if they want to wall it off from their kids or mix Hulu content in.Right now their kids can access Splash, Marvel content like Runaways, 10 Things I Hate About You, etc. with far more adult implications and there is no content lock or filter.It\\'s really just a UI and App challenge once they control the licenses.But it is also priced to reflect this.  I\\'m pretty sure the fact that they own all the content instead of farming out for third-party content like other services do plus the limited scope of the content which seemed to be pretty clearly laid out to people before they bought into it are why it is cheaper than other services.  Now we want everything they clearly weren\\'t going to offer but at that low price...Disney’s goal for Disney+ is not to be a Netflix challenger. Their goal is to change the way they can monetize their library: by cutting out the middleman and streaming their content themselves.They decided to reboot Lizzie McGuire at D23 last year. It was a huge announcement! And it implied that Lizzie would be going through more adult experiences. Everyone assumed it would be rated TV-14, which is how the creator of the show, Terri Minsky, started to write it.But, the higher ups at Disney decided they didn\\'t want that kind of content on the service and so they fired the show creator (first big red flag there), and then preceded to halt production on the show so that they could find someone who would make the show more like how they envisioned. Hilary Duff took to twitter and instagram to share her disappointment and that\\'s why I\\'m encouraging everyone to talk about it.Mandalorian is built off an almost 45 year old franchise with roots in pg-13 since the beginning. Lizzie Mcguire(a tv show who\\'s movie barely scraped into PG because of Mild Thematic Elements) is built off the back of Disney Channel-a channel who famously canceled Girl Meets World because the subject matter was getting too adult(which it also tried to do to it\\'s parent show before it channel hopped).My point here is \"too adult\" is DEFINITELY in play-girl meets world and raven\\'s home both took a step back in the maturity of its material when compared to the themes of their previous show\\'s final seasons. It\\'s entirely disney\\'s mo to lose sight of the idea that their original demographic has grown up and would be better serviced by a more adult show. For whatever reason they view star wars as an adult franchise and theyre allowed to so mature things with it. Lizzie Mcguire, less so.Shhhh, honesty will get you downvoted round these parts.Unfortunately, the reality is that Hilary Duff did not sign on to do this kind of show. She will walk away when her contract is up, if her current tweets and instagram posts are any clue, because she is unhappy with how it became a bait and switch for her. Disney does need to change it or else the show will not succeed.I may be misremembering this but I seem to recall Hilary Duff once posting on social media that she wanted her NYC neighbor arrested because he was.....*smoking weed inside of his own home*. She doesn’t seem like she’d be fun to work with.Nope, Simpsons were part of Fox that Disney bought. Family Guy is Adult Swim’sThe Mandalorian is TV-14 which just makes this whole thing even more ridiculous.Avenger endgame is on d+ snd thanos gets his head slice up.I agree. I can understand Disney wanting to stay family friendly and avoiding TV-MA or R ratings away from their streaming platform, but I don’t see why a show can’t be made for adults that grew up with Lizzie with a TV-14 rating. Especially when there are already movies and shows on the platform that aren’t necessarily appropriate for small children. Someone needs to remind Disney that it’s the adults that are paying for the service and it’s those adults that will stop paying if it becomes easier/cheaper to just buy a movie for their kids to watch on repeat.Honestly I feel like a sizable chunk of Disney’s viewership as of late is age 13 and up. I think it’s mainly parents and older siblings to take them to see Disney related content so why not just let go of the younger audience. I’ve taken my little brother to every MCU and Star Wars movies since he was a kid and he’s now 14. I’ve seen sooo many more adults at these movies (even movies like Lion King and Aladdin).Hulu is only accesible in the USA, so the show wouldn\\'t reach internationally. That\\'s why it would be amazing if this and Love Victor stayed in D+I keep seeing Girl Meets World brought up in comparison to this situation. What kinda stuff were they trying to do that got them canceled? I don\\'t follow that show so I don\\'t know the story, can you elaborate?what did she tweet? I only saw the two Instagram postsYou\\'re conflating ownership with syndication.The Simpsons and Family Guy are both owned by 20th Television, now part of Disney.Syndication for Family Guy has been held by TBS and Adult Swim since 2003; Season 16 and later are held by Freeform and FXX (now both owned by Disney), and in 2021, all seasons will be on Freeform/FXX.The current TBS/Adult Swim contract probably would prevent Family Guy from being on Disney Plus, whereas The Simpsons syndication is already entirely within Disney\\'s control.Mandalorian is TV-PGThe difference there, I\\'m assuming, is dat marvel money whereas Lizzie McGuire Reboot is an introduction to more adult themes on what would be a Disney original which would be a newer \"riskier\" thing with no where near there potential of money compared to marvel. This is my assumption, I think it\\'s a stupid as poop* call made by Disney exec\\'s though.Edit: Comment was removed due to poop language.Hulu is going to start launching internationally in 2021.Oh oops lmaoEither way, it\\'s annoying. In other countries can be expensive. The most basic D+ plan (the one for 7 dollars) is actually cheap when converted to my local coin (22 ish soles peruanos) but if you the bundle and Hulu\\'s no ads or with ads, it gets more expensive. Like, almost Netflix expensive (50ish soles, which is pretty okay, but if you have both services, the it\\'s around 90+ soles).If they were only on D+ it would actually be better cause it\\'s one less service to have. I know we don\\'t need to have Netflix, but when it\\'s really big and has good content, then I doubt my family\\'s gonna wanna trade them.Wait, really??Someone on Reddit admitted they were wrong! Someone shoot him!I agree, they should merge Hulu (Hotstar for India) and Disney+. Disney+ looks like it will have good pg-pg13 and Hulu’s has good adult content. If they ever want to charge as much as Netflix they will need to have content for everyone not just families.Yep! There\\'s plans to roll out Hulu internationally next year! So don\\'t worry!I’m late to the party but I finally started The Imagineering Story. I genuinely thought it would be Disney high fiving themselves with their world domination. Walt genuinely believed in what he was doing with his vision and the people he attracted were ridiculously talented. Can’t recommend it enough.Zootopia and my typical Simpsons run :) Catching up on the last few seasonsFor Disney Channel Sitcoms, just choose your favourite nostalgic one!Imagination Movers!!!Any Muppetsanyone know when disney+ is coming norway? i\\'m getting tired of being teased by the americans making memes about baby yodaWe are watching the Kim Possible cartoon series, so nostalgic, I love it!We also watched Toy Story 1 and 2 this week, next week is 3 and 4In honor of Onward opening this week I would watch a good Pixar movie. I’m currently watching UP and then I’m watching The Incredibles!I’ve just been binging Simpsons since it came out still. On season 9 or 10 now. Going to go back and watch Gargoylescan\\'t watch. the stupid website sucks.It’s the best thing on Disney+ without a doubt.Simpsons!!!Haha I havent hit these yet. Working on simpsonsI love.muppetsLoveHaha I\\'m up to 19 for simpsonsHavrnt even touched anything elseI just searched for it, and didn’t see it.I keep hoping Disney + will add it with each update.  That and Pickle and Peanut.Update:. Fish Hooks is coming April 3rd!!!https://decider.com/2020/03/18/disney-plus-april-2020-new-on/a lot of those animated Marvel movies are currently owned by Lionsgate so they probably won\\'t be on there anytime soonThe rights are still held by Lionsgate.They should, but honestly most of them suck (especially compared to the DC animated films) so I\\'m not too disappointed they aren\\'t.I for one would love for Disney to buy the rights away from Lionsgate as  we need more animated features from Marvel on Disney+. While we\\'re at it let\\'s try to get  *Marvel Super Hero Adventures: Frost Fight!*  *Hulk: Where Monsters Dwell*  *Iron Man and Captain America: Heroes United*If say I’d prefer them to get Spectacular Spider-Man from Sony before the other animated showes from Lionsgate.They\\'re still on netflix.As others have said, Lionsgate owns these films. Unless Disney buys them back, they\\'re not gonna be on here.I\\'m still trying to find a place to watch Marvel Super-Heroes from the 1960\\'s.Is the tv show on Disney+?  I haven’t watched that show in years.They should make original Marvel animated movies for Disney plus only.I want to watch ultimate avengers so badWow, that\\'s disappointing. It\\'s sad Disney can\\'t bring the full list of their own stuff under their umbrella. I knew about Hulk and Spider-Man, but not this. Add this to the Muppets which can\\'t be complete and is missing the original film. Then there\\'s rights issues keeping Muppet Show or Muppet Babies away. And even things like Brave Little Toaster 2, but not 1.I don\\'t think Disney should own everything but it\\'s frustrating when they can\\'t even negotiate / buy back the rights to pieces of things that they DO own. It keeps the service feeling incomplete.Marvel has better movies.  DC has been animated movies,  that was,  is,  and probably will always be my view on it.Fair pointDr. Strange was pretty great thoughThe Hulk one was greatI think they\\'re all on Netflix, btw. I\\'ve seen most of these.Planet hulk is my favorite animated comic book movie ever. The rest.... mehWell until then, all the ones you just mentioned are on Netflix. In addition there’s also a few LEGO Marvel animated features on there as well.I\\'m surprised that they haven\\'t added Spider-Man 67 to the service.Yes there are some shows on Disney+The Muppet Movie is on Disney+You think Disney could license it for it\\'s streaming service like how Netflix does with all it\\'s non-original content.Even if they could get everything they own on Disney+ that doesn\\'t mean they will. Those Marvel shows on Netflix and Hulu will probably never be on Disney+ because they\\'re too mature. I mean the Lizzie Maguire revival isn\\'t even going to be on Disney+, and it might not be completed because Disney didn\\'t like the mature Lizzie angle.My opinion on what company had the best at. Marvel: Live action moviesDC: Animated movies, Animated TV shows, Live action Shows, and comicsYeah, I\\'m DC biased,  but I do know Marvel has some good comics here and there.DC has R rated films too, Deadpool and Logan is what it could have but I am scared for the future.My opinion on what company had the best at. Marvel: Live action moviesDC: Animated movies, Animated TV shows, Live action Shows, and comicsYeah, I\\'m DC biased,  but I do know Marvel has some good comics here and there.Thanks.[deleted]Hulu is basically the grown up version of D+ though, Disney controls and pretty much owns it and NBC is launching their own streaming service so they could conceivably sell their last bit off to Disney anyway. Disney would and probably already has put anything deemed \"too mature\" for D+ on Hulu. (Quick googling tells me that they just moved a *Love, Simon* spin-off from D+ to Hulu for that exact reason.)I had to explain the comics to a friend recently. Marvel has better street level heroes and own Spider-manDC has better Cosmic level heroes and own Batman.The original Muppet movie is on Disney+ as well as the 2011 one...Also High Fidelity.My point was that Disney doesn\\'t want everything under the Disney+ banner so even if they could get the rights to everything it doesn\\'t mean everything will be on Disney+.The problem with this is they originally said everything Disney, Marvel, and Star Wars would be available from the same place. Obviously that isn\\'t possible if they want to keep Disney+ completely family friendly. At this point there isn\\'t much reason for me to subscribe except for the nostalgic TV shows and movies.I think it\\'s the opposite. With how Marvel is doing everything right now, and with last year\\'s Thor crossovers, it\\'s harder to get into Marvel comics. And it doesn\\'t help that Marvel goes back on numbing (issue 20 or something will to back to issue 1, but see the same story).  DC it\\'s making it easier to get into their comics. Yeah, a big number like issue 70 of Batman is a little daunting. But DC makes everything easier to digest. At least for me, that\\'s my opinion.Bendis ruined Marvel for a decade.I\\'m not going to be able to explain this hot take correctly,  so please give me a bit of room for trying to explain it/seeing my point. Marvel ruined Bendis by not reigning him in or forcing him to grow. He had a hit and a great idea. Then they gave him the keys to the Kingdom with no repercussions or (imo)  true oversight. I think Bendis got away with using the same voice for too long.I think Bendis got away with having no talent. He has a basic inability to write anything that wasn\\'t crime fiction, his dialogue is weak and full of repetition, his plotting is even worse, and he let artists go crazy abusing splash pages when he didn\\'t feel like writing anything. He also hired a bunch of crap writers based on agreeing with his personal and political prejudices, rather than having any talent. His writing on team books is some of the worst stuff I\\'ve ever seen. Guardians of the Galaxy, which A-L basically revived was totally ruined by him. Plus, there\\'s those awful 6000 issue crossovers. He literally took over or killed anything good that managed to happen when they made him EIC, which was a total catastrophe.Skateman is better written than anything he\\'s done in the last 15 years.I can agree he never deserved EIC which is sort if my point.  However I do think he had talent that he just never hit his potential with because of an early win.I\\'ve tried uninstalling/reinstalling, clearing data, clearing cache, rebooting router, everything I can think of. Are the Disney+ servers just down?I\\'m located in the Western USEDIT: Just got resolved about 4 minutes after making this post.How?Dont know. It just started working. It had been about 14 hours of it showing that page everytime I went on the app, then it just workedYeah it isn\\'t working on my Sony either after the latest update. Disney support said they put in a ticket to tech support but who knows when they may fix it.On my Galaxy s9+, the only version of the app that supports HDR is 1.0.1That is Disney’s biggest downfall for this service. While I love everything Disney, it wouldn’t hurt to have more PG-13 content and even R Rated content. Seeing how they own Fox, they could bring plenty of movies from them that are bangers and heck, Disney themselves can make more adult content that doesn’t focus on Marvel or Star Wars.Disney+ isn\\'t trying to be the new Netflix, nor should it. They clearly have a target audience in mind and probably a more loyal one, families with children. Disney+ is going to be staple is this audience. If you want your kids to have some quiet time, just put on Disney+. Honestly they could do a bit more with PG-13 material aimed at an older audience. But TVMA and R Rated material hurts the family branding of the streaming service.The \"Disney\" brand has always been about family-friendly service. Have you watched the Disney Channel on cable TV? What kind of shows do thy have? Family friendly. Ever been to Disney Land or Disney World? What\\'s it like? Family Friendly. That is the brand that is Disney.Disney the corporation owns several other media companies that may not fall under the \"family-friendly\" banner. Go to [ESPN.com](https://ESPN.com). You have to go off to the very bottom of the page, and go to one of those links that nobody ever clicks on (\"Terms of Use\", Privacy Policy\", etc.) to find the Disney logo. It\\'s not a secret that Disney owns ESPN, but it doesn\\'t use the \"Disney\" brand because it\\'s not family friendly - It\\'s sports. in fact, Disney created Touchstone back in the 80\\'s when it decided to get into more mature content that wouldn\\'t fit into the family friendly brand of \"Disney\". Touchstone Films and Touchstone Pictures were used to produce and distribute those films. These are films like *Pretty Woman*, *Armageddon*, *Pearl Harbor*, and others.You want more mature content, go to Hulu. That\\'s where Disney is putting the more mature content. And by the way - Hulu is one of those companies that Disney owns (majority, controlling shares), but that doesn\\'t use the Disney brand. This is where  *Love Victor* is going to be, and possibly the revival of *Lizzie McGuire*, which currently is in hiatus. I also bet you have not seen a single episode of either of these two show, and have no idea what the content is. A show about a 13 year old girl is going to be a lot different than one about a 30-something adult woman.I\\'m guessing more adults pay for the service, so they should provide content for them, otherwise why do they even have a Kids option to restrict content?That’s why they have Hulu. If you want adult shows you should get Hulu. But I agree that they should have more PG-13 and TV-14 Movie / ShowsUnnecessary. This is why they have and continue to invest in Hulu. There\\'s a group of people who seem to be obsessed with seeing R or PG-13 rated content shown on a Disney labeled channel, but it isn\\'t going to happen because they simply don\\'t have to do it.this. people say that’s why they are investing in hulu but owning two services is honestly a bad idea. people subscribe for convenience, and making families pay for two subscriptions is not convenient. also imo the hulu UI is inferior to Disney+, which sucks.Why not have Disney after dark as an option for that type of content? Hulu is too expensive.What about the countries that don\\'t have hulu>If you want adult shows you should get Hulu.Not available in my country though :|I really wish they would can hulu and move it’s best features over to disney+. the UI is still horrible imo.Hulu, which is only available in the USA. Therefore it would be a very good idea to roll out this streamingservice to the rest of the world. I totally agree with ts: Disney+ on it\\'s own, which only have content for children and teenagers, will not survive in the long run. The first signs of that are already visible in my country (the Netherlands), it doesn\\'t look good...Because they don\\'t need to. Disney has worked very hard to maintain it\\'s brand. They don\\'t want to do anything that could hurt that image.Disney plus and Hulu are literally the cheapest options of all streaming services.Idk as Hulu is planning to go worldwide soonDisney has stated that they plan to roll out Hulu internationally, but this is going to take time. I am sure they understand that their current content is mainly focused on families; that probably explains why Disney+ is priced so much cheaper than Netflix.What we should realize is that Disney is in this for the long run. Their goal is not to become bigger than Netflix or HBO; they don’t expect Disney+ on its own to do that. Their goal is to adjust the way they make money off their TV and movie output to the realities of the streaming age. They do this by cutting out the middleman (Netflix, Starz, etc.) and streaming their properties themselves instead. They expect Disney+ to operate at a loss in its first 5 years. The service had been live for only 3 months and in about 4 markets. This is only the start. I agree with you that Disney+ in the Netherlands could be much better. We are missing out on a lot of library content that has been made available in other markets... there is no sign of classic titles like The Rescuers, TaleSpin, Bonkers, and Mickey’s Christmas Carol. Worse is that only 10 classic cartoons were made available. Also many classic Walt-era specials are missing. (This is no licensing/rights issue; I am quite sure an obscure special like ‘I captured the King of the Leprechauns’ is not licensed to any other party.)If this content remains unavailable, Disney+ will become less interesting for viewers at some point. The risk here of that is bigger than in the US I would say.I can\\'t pay $12 for Hulu and still get Disney.. ads are for chumpsI deal with ads because I pay $5 a month to Spotify and it also comes with Hulu.Plus the 4 year puts me at under 10 for Disney Hulu and Spotify.I would think if they told you they processed it. You\\'d have gotten the refund. I say they lying to you for sure. Definitely is NOT processed if that\\'s the case. Tell them what the definition of processed means.What should I do? I don’t really know what to do, I’m stumped :,( they have all the notes, I thought about calling and asking them to email me ALL the transcripts and the actual receipt of them sending my refund and process to verify to my “bank” I don’t think they’d fight me if I ask that way, I just want this refund 😢When tcw was ported over, the majorly messed up the animation, lightsabers look darker when moving fast and it overall just looks worse, sorry to break it, but it\\'s probably from the porting.I doubt it.The same thing happened when Rebels was airing and watching it on TVWatching it on my PC and phone though, the sabers looked normal and fineI’m so bummed about this. Lizzie was a huge part of my life growing up and I was so excited to see the reboot. Good for Hilary Duff though, for wanting to honor that her character has grown up like everyone else.Disney is so averse to putting out adult centric (not mature, but not centered squarely to children) content on Disney+ but is completely fine with putting Star Wars and Marvel out there where people are outright murdered in sometimes horrific ways and themes such as alcoholism and the dangers of mass surveillance are prevalent. Disney needs to think good and hard on what exactly they want to put on Disney+, because outside of nostalgia there’s nothing that’s actually intriguing with this now out. I’m expecting the Marvel shows to be nothing more than Marvel Lite films, and I have to wait a year for Mando. God knows what they’re doing with Kenobi, and I’ve already watched the old shows and movies I wanted to watch.I hope they do move it but damn I really paid a year of Disney+ only for two of the shows I was anticipating, Love Simon and Lizzie, being dropped from the service.  Those Marvel shows better be worth it.With this and Love, Simon... Disney Plus is looking really really bad. Those were two shows I was dying to see and now their restrictions are causing both to either change networks or get cancelled it’s ridiculous. Age restrictions exist on Netflix, it’s possible. Seeing Lizzie take a shot of tequila isn’t going to dilute the Disney brand. That’s so stupid.lol this show is never getting madeI love how this is big news everywhere else but this sub....Wow, respect for Hillary Duff, the best HillaryWill it still be on D+ UK/non US though? All these cries to put it on Hulu when Hulu is barely anywhere in the worldThis sucks... Disney+ is not looking too hot in terms of original content. Monsters At Work was delayed as well :/. Also, I can’t believe this because they even started filming with that one scene being released already (the scene that was in wha coming to Disney+ in 2020 video).I hope this gets made. if there\\'s no significant updates regarding the production moving forward ima just cancel my subscription. Literally the main reason I subscribed when they announced this.I mean I know they say no press is bad press but between Love Simon, this and Monsters at Work being delayed.. D+ isn\\'t really looking too good. This show and Love, Simon were the only reasons I subscribed. If they confirm it\\'s not happening I am going to unsubscribe.Man I loved that show but if the reboot was gonna be anything like ravens home or girl meets world than I\\'m fine with it never happeningWait whatAs much as I wanted this, maybe it\\'s for the best. Honestly the only people who would be interested in this aren\\'t really Disney\\'s target demographic, TV wise anyway. I was never really sure how Disney would manage to make a show about a 30yo anyway.Hopefully someone else can pick it up though because this would have been amazing.I was worried about this from the beginning because I knew Disney would try to restrict too much of a 30 year olds life. I hope it moves to Hulu.She already stars in \"Younger\", a show where she plays a millennial in NYC having sex, drinking and facing \"real life\" drama.  Everything I hear about this now sounds like Hillary Duff wants to make \"Younger\" but take away Sutton Fosters character and make Duffs character the lead.So what happened? The show is canceled cus they tryna make it rated R?Needs to be on Hulu.Authentic? Not to be mean, but she was home-schooled and a working actress that was mainly around other actors like her, and the creator was a mid-40s-50s woman probably very out of her time. Neither knew what an actual teenager was going through. Just make a dang family friendly show. No reason to \"get real\" now.what is huluFor real. What really sucks about this whole situation is Disney execs approved the OG concept and were okay with it until they abruptly decided to change course to make the show more \"PG\" (likely more like Girl Meets World/Raven\\'s Home) *while the show was in the middle of filming.*Like Duff is being gracious as hell in her statements after all the mess Disney put her and Minsky through.I wonder how long the actors are on contract for because Disney will probably have to make an official statement on the show\\'s status soon now that Duff has released a statement about things.Totally agreed. They’re going to realize that they cannot keep up growth while completely disregarding adult content outside of mostly Marvel.disney is a bunch of hypocrites clearly. let lizzie fu¢k **who cares** i just want to see her!!!!Marvel and Star Wars are different than the core Disney brand. PG-13 is fine.Disney branded stuff is going to max out at PG.I\\'m still not certain how this confuses people. They don\\'t want angry parents watching a Disney branded show and it starts talking about adult issues.they aren’t even premiering within the first year though rightIf Disney was a European company it would probably be no issue… but ‘murica and its values 😪They already filmed two episodes before it got put on hold.From what happens here in Canada, all Hulu originals end up airing on cable-network channels so either this and that \"Love, Simon\" show might end up airing on a cable channel or Disney might bring Hulu to other places in the world.They actually filmed 2 episodes. After that production was already on hiatus as Hillary Duff was on her Honeymoon. At that point Terri Minsky was removed as Showrunner.Monsters at Work didn\\'t get delayed so much as they probably haven\\'t even really gotten halfway finished with it yet.A lot of people said it would come out this March, but I don\\'t think the creators or Disney officially said that.Best case scenario at this point is that it\\'s moved to Hulu. We\\'ll still get the show, just not on Disney+ which I\\'m fine with since it seems like Disney had more in mind of a watered down kiddy reboot of the original (see: Raven\\'s Home/Girl Meets World). Terri seems up to return as show runner if it goes to Hulu and she\\'ll be able to make the show she had intended to make when she signed up.At this point there seems to be little chance of it happening on Disney plusI have to agree 100%.If she objected to doing it so much, she should\\'ve turned down the paycheck. It\\'s a job.It always baffles me how much public complaining some of these actors get away with. I\\'d never hire someone like that.What’s the problem? I mean you have a point but I like how they what to be realistic to seeing her be all grown up. With this more adult theme, they can cover depression and her love life more deeply.Yeah I gotta go with this.All these Disney shows were written by geriatrics.Another streaming service that has plenty of adult content such as Family Guy, and all the movies and such. Disney owns Hulu now but they’re far different from Disney.Oh definitely, I agree. They’re trying to cater to a really young audience in a show that’s being advertised as made for the adults who grew up with it. I’m definitely interested to see what will happen. I’m hoping they’ll release it somewhere else like Hulu, but knowing Disney, I’m not very optimistic.Was the original not pg rated?Idk if they gave an official date but I read that The Falcon and Winter Solider will premiere this summer and WandaVision after that. So for sure one of them will premiere within the first year.Thats the frustrating thing though, Disney is big enough to push the envelopeDisney did say it was coming in 2020. It’s no longer coming in 2020 = delayed.I would love if Terri were to return. She made character arcs in Andi Mack that made me absolutely cry. It was Disney Magic. And it was about the real world. She is fantastic at what she does and she needs to tell more stories.yeah I agree on that. I have hulu too so I at least want it to move forward there.Tonally it\\'ll be an inconsistent world. Viewers will watch the first episode, go \"meh, it\\'s not the same\" and not watch anymore. I\\'m sure there\\'s a very good reason why Disney didn\\'t want to move forward in that direction.what is a streaming serviceWell, in terms of cursing, sex, etc. we don\\'t know. But the show was definitely very much about a grown up Lizzie, and the reboot was not in the way of Disney reboots Raven\\'s Home or Girl Meets World (i.e. the OG cast\\'s kids were the main focus, the OG cast were more the supporting roles).The original concept for this new LM was more about the trials and tribulations that Lizzie experiences as an adult. According to some people in the initial thread from a few days ago in the television sub, the basic premise of the pilot was that Lizzie, who at 30 seemed to have it all (lives in NY, good job, great boyfriend and best friend \\\\[new characters\\\\]), finds out her best friend slept with her boyfriend (Lizzie finds the friend\\'s earring in her and her boyfriend\\'s bed).Things happen after she breaks up with her boyfriend where she ends up moving into her parents house.[deleted]At least D plus has the original seriesA streaming service is basically what we call these platforms. So whenever they say streaming service, it means a service where you can stream your favorite movies and shows, such as Disney+.> According to some people in the initial threadFor those who are wondering who the people in the initial thread are, the first person who said that had a \"friend of a friend\" who told the user and another user who implied they worked for Disney in some capacity said they read the script and said that was pretty accurate. That user also said they think the \"adult content\" was just mild swearing and infidelity.Link to the thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/f9z9zp/hilary_duff_calls_out_disney_for_lizzie_mcguire/fivhcy3/F you botwhat is a platformSo practical! So beautiful! Finally! Now... about that episode order issue and the lack of a \"viewing history\" or ability to log off all accounts...Not sure how it took this long to implement THIS but it\\'s a start.Now they need to have all episodes of shows that are on there. On a few of them it\\'s a random couple of episodes per season.And yet I still can\\'t get D Plus to keep track of where I left off in shows and movies.How about the ability to remove titles you don\\'t want to watch to make browsing easier?Now they just need a “Coming Soon” sectionYet they still haven\\'t fixed the watchlist...Finally! Good news!Great! Not very useful in the Netherlands though, as only 1 new show was added today; the totally uninteresting Shop Class. Our version of Disney+ is getting worse by the week. The annoying thing is that there is NO WAY of letting Disney know about it.[removed]Another thing they added is a “because you watched” (in my case, Coco). I never noticed that before.This is so awesome and very helpful, I’m also glad they added a row for Collections, though I wish the new collections they added would show up in the Search tabCan we maybe just have it not stream in 4K constantly? That’d be great for my dataDisney+ has been out for like three months. Isn\\'t pretty much everything new to Disney+?Great now we just need a leaving sectionIt is about time.That Lost cities shows sounds amazing!Well with the number of subscribers dropping every day they needed to do something.[removed][removed]Don’t forget the shuffle episodes button that’s been requested over and over>What I still hate is if you leave off on an episode and it\\'s in the credits and you try and re-watch the same episode it will play from the credits at the end like if my kids want to re-watch the same episode, I then have to physically rewind the episode.Yeah, with, of course, no mention of it. Poor Andi Mack.Exactly, I’m pretty surprised they added a feature like this. Even with the ramp up of Marvel and start wars shows in the fall, it’ll become apparent very quickly to people how small and slow new D+ content rollout will be, especially anyone used to Netflix.Oh was that new too? Cool! Didn\\'t even make the connection. They should also add a Watchlist row... Netflix has that one right. Less clicks = happier users.Thank you, that\\'s another of my top requests I forgot about. Doesn\\'t impact me, but it impacts a lot of people and feels like a necessity...Only in US have this problem, no? others regions don\\'t remove titles like US (because Fox contracts with HBO).No other streaming services have leaving sections.Oh please knower of all, pretty please show me where you got this information since nobody but Disney even knows how many subscribers there are.I can’t blame anyone. I cancelled after Mando wrapped up.Out of curiosity, what kind of posts do you expect or want on a sub dedicated to a service?Not sure announcing a new feature we wanted is an \\\\*ad\\\\*More like relief?[removed]as great as that would be, it\\'s not a feature present on any other streaming service so i imagine it\\'s lowest on their list. If anything they need to first keep up with the Jonses. But that is a fantastic idea... it would encourage so much discovery!Why would you want to shuffle episodes of a series? They\\'ll be all out of orderI would love just to watch a random anything on here more than any other service.Well to be fair Andi Mack\\'s episodes were removed because one of the actors was a sex offenderThat was exactly what I was thinking of lolYeah my mind was blown by the March 1st \"coming soon\" list. And the February 1st. January 1st had like 20-30 new titles - on par with Hulu or Netflix. February had 4 and March 2. The speed of additions is discouraging as heck even in America. If you aren\\'t looking forward to  one or two of the legacy titles they add each month you\\'re basically left craving the next month and hoping to finally get the legacy content you hoped would be there before launch....I will get downvoted for this as usual, but it\\'s apparently a bad thing to say reality / documentaries don\\'t interest me and that is largely what D+ adds.Well other platforms have a way of informing people what\\'s leaving, Netflix puts out something every month telling what\\'s coming and goingHBO does, and Hulu/Netflix you can see expiration in your listThat\\'s blatantly wrong. Hulu does for one thing, among others.In fairness, my group of friends (older millennials) all cancelled unless they had children. Their reasons were all a variation of \"it\\'s just for kids right now.\" He may not be wrong although we\\'ll know a lot more during the next earnings call in May about how things have slowed or fallen. I\\'m begging them to rethink their strategy and really wish Love Victor and Lizzie McGuire and a suddenly new President would lead to that....Go to Netflix or Hulu subs and you\\'ll see the difference. Anything negative about the service here literally gets downvoted to hell.[removed]Hulu had it on Seinfeld The “yada yada yada” buttonNetflix kind of has this. I\\'ve noticed on my smart TV, there is an option for playing an episode at random. I\\'ve never used it, but I\\'ve definitely seen it as an option for The Office.Some shows are random anyway so the order doesn’t matter but even if they do have a specific order it’s annoying to watch the same episodes in the same order over and over.I’m not good at explaining but for example just imagine there’s a show with 6 seasons you’ve already seen all of and love so you turn it on sometimes to pass the time but never actually watch it all fully through again so If you do this enough times you would have the watched the same few episodes of the first season way more then the later seasons. A shuffle button would fix that.So was Ferris Bueller\\'s principal.  Doesn\\'t mean that we shouldn\\'t watch a classic.Was that ever stated by anyone officially? Cause if that’s the case I would have expected them to not be able to be purchased, yet when I checked the iTunes Store it looked like all the episodes where available for purchase.That’s not the same thing.true they have an expiring tab for show or films expiring within a month (if they\\'re added to your list). Hercules was on it all month until recently. I guess they renewed the license which is odd... not sure why they\\'d extend its stay on Hulu when the goal seems to be all the Disney Animated Canon exclusive to D+.Bro I\\'m downvoted here ALL the time for critical comments. It\\'s disturbing. but no, this was relief... I have a LOT of frustration and disappointment with the service. But I can celebrate the good stuff. A year from now I put really love this thing if they put work into it.you guys are weird. announcing a new feature we have been begging for was finally added isn\\'t marketing. it\\'s relief.I believe Netflix was A/B testing it on some shows, but I don\\'t think it ever fully rolled out to everyone.That\\'s a pretty good point!What really?Found an article explaining the situation, don\\'t know why it\\'s on Ituneshttps://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/disney-actor-stoney-westmoreland-underage-sex-case-1171610Wonder why... it really IS a great idea. You can shuffle music... why not tv / movies? I would go as far as to say this is now my #1 request AFTER they fix all the missing features other services have already.Let\\'s get a thumbs up / down and a viewing history so we have control over our recommendations.Let\\'s get a way to add things to our list from their icon in search without having to click through.Let\\'s get device control. I wanna know which devices are logged in, remove some, or log all out at once.Yes, I know the guy was a pedo, what I’m asking is was it stated officially that that was the reason those eps weren’t on Disney+?Yes it was, noticed thar episodes removed featured him in thembut the problem is --- they should mention this. i dont know how, but the show should have a disclaimer that episodes ARE missing with some sort of explanation. It\\'s very odd for fans and keeps new fans from having any desire to watch...Same with the baby jungle book series. We need more old Disney tv added.Maybe they lost the masters or haven\\'t transferred to digital. Kinda shocked so much is on, but not that.There already was in the 90s. I mean, a remake would be niceI agree! Would love to see Hercules, TaleSpin, Teacher’s Pet, Doug, Bonkers, and Emperor’s New School as well!I have to assume it\\'s either that, or there is some weird licensing issue.I mean the 90s series isn\\'t on Disney+ even though other 90s series, like Little Mermaid and Hercules, are.But they do have everything you listed available? At least it’s showing here in the US.Did D+ reformat the Little Mermaid &/or Hercules series like they did first 20-some years of The Simpsons? Maybe they\\'re reformatting all the older stuff, & just haven\\'t gotten around to the Aladdin series yet. I couldn\\'t find any legal reason it\\'s not up yet. Disney owns it.A lot of shows from the 90’s and earlier may not have nice HD digital versions available.   I suspect Disney is putting a fair amount of labour to get new transfers from the analog archival tapes to make high quality digital editions for steaming.There is also the problem of having to do new clearances for rights.  That’s probably not an issue for Aladdin, but any show with licensed music, characters, &c, may need to get a new set of licensing done.Not in the Netherlands. We also miss The Rescuers, Mickey’s Christmas Carol and have only 10 classic cartoons. Obviously we are less important to Disney.The aspect ratio is still the same but it might be a higher resolution than the old TV versions. I\\'m not sure.The Disney afternoon stuff like Darkwing Duck is OAR and looks like it\\'s SD. I mean looks fine but a bit soft, I think it\\'s off media and not masters. I don\\'t care personally, I just want to watch the shows.I doubt they\\'re going to remaster anything. I think they may not have masters for some of this anymore of stuff they haven\\'t re-aired much in recent years, which is insane, but not totally implausible.The 90s shows are being put up in SD for the most part.Aw terrible trade off for getting to preview it first. Hopefully it becomes available soon.It\\'s probably something simple like not wanting to release everything at once or not wanting to overshadow the new live action movie. I certainly can\\'t find any instances of Disney saying \"screw the Aladdin series,\" so my guess is it\\'ll be there eventually.WhatsOnDisneyPlus is an unofficial (and poor website with the writing skills of an 8 year old) so them removing an article doesn’t confirm anything.As expected, this list had a lot of accurate info, proving that the leak was real. It turns out \"Life on the Edge\" (previously unannounced, thus proving the leak) isn\\'t about Carrie Fisher, but it a Penguins related special feature. Music of Coco was also announced through the leak and now confirmed to be coming in April.&#x200B;Becoming, Elephants, Marvel\\'s Storyboards, and the Big Fib did not arrive but still, pretty accurate leak. At least one of those will probably get surprise-added before May 1st anyway.okay then. It\\'s accurate because of the fact that it revealed a bunch of shows that hadn\\'t been revealed yet and within weeks of them posting it slowly those shows started to get confirmed publicly like meet the chimpsanother example is that music of coco title was revealed for the first time months ago in this leak and now all of a sudden it has been rated and appears with a release date for the Netherlands of March 20th, per that link.I\\'ll give him my faith since this was a leak sent to them and then they deleted it because the company asked them to take it down for revealing info too far out. this does tend to happen.this leak also helped reveal that monsters at work was going to be delayed until next year because it was not mentioned on the roadmap and he called that out.It’s total bullshit. And the fact that he removed it just goes to show how weak they are. How do you know Disney requested that they remove it? And if that’s true, why would you do it. That’s a huge exclusive content. Your points are invalid.It didn’t reveal that Monsters At Work was delayed. That came out earlier this week, not via them.My points are not invalid. They are evidence - and monsters at works delay was hinted at in January when it was not on the list of titles for year 1. just because the press didn\\'t pick it up doesn\\'t mean it was revealed there first. And the reason it was taken down is because it was requested to be taken down. That is how things like this work... Disney often forces blogs to remove information that was posted without their permission via cease and desist. why don\\'t you just wait 3 weeks and save this and come back and realize that the titles I said would premiere do premiere. have faith.You can’t take a blog post down via cease and desist for reporting news. Hahahahahaha. There would be no blogs left. Bloggers have the right to blog. I’m not saying your list isn’t true. My issue isn’t you or the list, my issue is poor websites like that.I remember vividly sites being forced to remove content in the past by disney threats - including leaked toy images from star wars.>As expected, this list had a lot of accurate info, proving that the leak was real. It turns out \"Life on the Edge\" (previously unannounced, thus proving the leak) isn\\'t about Carrie Fisher, but it a Penguins related special feature. Music of Coco was also announced through the leak and now confirmed to be coming in April.  >  >Becoming, Elephants, Marvel\\'s Storyboards, and the Big Fib did not arrive but still, pretty accurate leak. At least one of those will probably get surprise-added before May 1st anyway.Yeah, it was real, as I said. The \"coming in April\" list confirmed it.It turns out \"Life on the Edge\" (previously unannounced, thus proving the leak) isn\\'t about Carrie Fisher, but it a Penguins related special feature. Music of Coco was also announced through the leak and now confirmed to be coming in April.Becoming, Elephants, Marvel\\'s Storyboards, and the Big Fib did not arrive but still, pretty accurate. At least one of those will probably get surprise-added before May 1st anyway. For example, Disney Insider was part of the leak for March and was recently confirmed to be starting March 20th. What\\'s weird is that Disney Insider is a weekly new series but has no episodes on the \"coming in April\" announcement they just made. Disney is so unorganized.Wow you’re still on this. So some things in the “leak” were correct. Cool. Many weren’t. Some could have been educated guesses too. My issue is still not the leak. It’s the shitty website.I\\'m not on anything. It\\'s common to follow up on something after it\\'s been proven.It wasn’t proven. There were multiple things that were incorrect.Oh, okay, so the guy made up titles of films and shows never before announced and you still doubt the leak? Okay. I get it, the site sucks. The leak was real. Disney Plus can\\'t even announce what\\'s coming in the next month  and then follow through on that weeks later, so it makes a lot of sense that there would be changes to the leaked roadmap as well. Disney Plus is wildly unorganized right now.   Right now we are still missing a lot of March content that Disney themselves sent out to the press they were gonna be adding. It\\'s so annoying.They really should alter the \"existing agreements\" blurb for films like this though... How about... \"Coming March 13, 2020!\" The end...I actually hope it comes to Disney+ a lot earlier than December. Honestly, it’s one of my favorite Steve Martin movies!I would like them to put up the video that they played in the Mr Lincoln theatre during Disneyland’s 50th anniversary that was hosted by SteveIt is already available in the Netherlands. For some reason we get this, while a large part of the classic Disney library content is held back for us. I’d love to understand the reasoning behind that!May have been me - because it\\'s in other territories and doesn\\'t appear on Starz, HBO,  and Netflix or Hulu, I feel pretty confident it will be arriving. That along with Peanuts, and the X-men movies.I live in the United States.Yes, I gathered as much. My point was that there seems to be no logic behind the way content is (un)available in different regions.Licensing rights For example, UK D+ won\\'t be getting simpsons as Sky and Channel4 \"own\" itIt\\'s the same in other countriesYes, that may be the case for some movies. But it doesn’t explain why a movie like My Dog, The Thief (1969), or the 1955 Mickey Mouse Club series have been added to Disney+ in the US but not in the Netherlands. I would be VERY surprised if ancient (and to non-Disney fans obscure) content like this has been licensed to any other party in the Netherlands :-) No, this seems to be a case where Disney is just unwilling to make an effort.AppleTV, Roku, and Amazon all have devices you can hook to your tv to make them smart.Here’s a list: https://www.androidcentral.com/what-devices-can-you-watch-disney-plusYou could either buy Apple TV, Chromecast, Roku, or Firestick. They are easy to connect to your tv using a hdmi-cable.The Chromecast is probably the least expensive, easiest-to-use option. I bought it specifically for Disney+ and ended up using it for that and everything else. I hope that helps :)!I am in a similar boat.  My ps3 is too old for Disney plus, my tv is as well.  However, I can connect my laptop to my tv via and hdmi cable, so we watch It that way.  I looked into a lot of options and debated between a roku/chrome cast as they are the least expensive,  however we went with the option of just connecting our laptop to the tv when we want to watch it.A ps4 or xbox1 will have it as an option as well if you have either of those.  But the cheapest option is just hooking your computer up and watching via the web browser.I\\'m not familiar with the wd tv hardware. I believe it\\'s legacy hardware.Did you look at a roku? That\\'ll hook right in, if your tv doesn\\'t have smart capabilities. Real easy to use.I use a rokuTV (and I had a roku hooked up to my SD TV which was about 20 years old, until I got a new HD one) and a ps4. If you or your kids have a ps4 or another current game console (has to be the current one, not old ones), that\\'ll work, too.That’s the way to goThe OP or his kids might have a ps4 or current generation video game console already, they all have the dis+ app. Would save $50-100But yeah, otherwise roku, chromecast, apple tv boxes all work fine.I finally bought roku and it works like a charm.Thanks to everybody.Oh true! I got my Cc for $30 tho, $50 seems a little steep.Fair.Yep looks like $35 for the regular CC now on amazon. Looks like firestick is $25. Roku is $40. Apple tv is $150They got cheaper than I remember.Sweet, I love Marvel + anime. Thanks for the heads up.edit: 5 episodes deep, this show is probably the best Marvel show aimed at kids since HULK: Agents of SmashThis happens to me frequently.  DisneyPlus seem to have multiple versions of the same movie.  My kids have a French account.  I have a English account.  When they start a movie, for instance Frozen.  The languages are French and English.  If I start Frozen from my account, languages may be different because my account is in English.  Sometimes movies get mixed up somehow.  If my kids look for Frozen on their account, the movie will be in french.  But if they start Frozen from the suggestion page (still in their account) the movie will be in English, Portuguese, Spanish, etc.  Then we have to stop the movie, go in the research box and look for the same movie again.  Then it will be in French.  Does that make any sense ?Just had the exact same issue. Sent a feedback report and cancelled my subscription until this is fixed. Fell asleep watching it in English. Tried it again today. French only audio track.I tried searching and also tried different profiles. All of them had a single audio track all in French. Disappointing.The funny thing is they greenlit Lizzie McGuire knowing what direction Terri Minsky wanted to take it and allowed them to shoot 2 episodes.I just want Hulu to come to CanadaAnd people were saying that this is a Netflix killer, lmfao not even close. They need more diverse PG13 content that isn\\'t just Marvel and Star wars.Yes, 100 percent. It\\'s bad, man. They tricked people into buying for certain shows then pulled them away...People internationally don’t have access to Hulu. I hate their attitude that anything that isn’t a complete baby show needs to be on Hulu. The service is just so limited and crappy outside of America already.Studios/streaming services cancel movies/shows, delay them, or change the method of release. It’s what most consumers have come to know and expect because it’s been industry practice forever. Changing a show from D+ to Hulu is nothing out of the ordinary. It may be frustrating, but it’s normal and not just a Disney thing.The shows you referenced are like if you bought nonrefundable tickets to an event over a year in advance. There’s no way to tell what will happen that early, and if it takes a turn for the worse, it’s your fault for gambling so early because nothing in the economy - including goods and services and their distribution - is 100% predictable.This is a reflection of Disney as a whole organization.It’s so stupid. There’s no reason not to put that stuff on the service. Hopefully the learn that sooner rather than laterMe too, friend. Me tooHonestly Netflix’s propensity for killing every half good show after three seasons that isn’t Stranger Things makes me wanna drop it too. Hulu is really the only one I consistently enjoy in terms of overall content. The original content on Netflix usually isn’t good, Disney+ has absolutely no content outside of nostalgia and Star Wars (the absolute best thing on the service is The Imagineering Story, Mando comes close) right now.Right, it could never. Netflix is for all-ages. This is for kids. Fortunately I enjoy content for youths as well, but I want more than that...Flying superheroes and laser swords aren\\'t gonna help Disney+, but they\\'re the focus of the platform lolIt\\'s pretty limited and crappy *inside* of America at the moment as well lolBut these are three shows that are being affected all for the same reason. Disney+ needs to figure out what it wants to be. I’m so disappointed by what’s happening with Lizzie McGuire.Disney refuses to be more darker and mature. That\\'s their downfallI think you VASTLY underestimate the need for Star Wars and Marvel fans to absorb all of the content released. They were actually very smart to focus on Pixar, Marvel, and Star Wars at first. You have die hard Pixar fans that finally have a library of every short, every film, every extra in one place . On the Marvel front of things, they effectively told the audience that the future of the MCU has Disney+ as a key component and you cannot continue to follow the story without the D+ content. And finally on the Star Wars side of things, they very much are positioning themselves to have the new expanded universe on Disney+. They actually pretty much expertly planned their future audience with this lineup.Except they also own huli... arguable the best run and most adult of all the streaming services.I think you are getting confused. D+ doesn\\'t have *Love, Simon* on it\\'s service, but I find nothing at all that says they will not have it because it\\'s too mature. I did find a lot of articles talking about Disney thinking the **spinoff** show, *Love, Victor* is too mature for D+. And the original *Lizzie McGuire* is on D+, and I can find no mention of any plans that it will be removed. It\\'s the **revival** show that D+ thinks is too mature.Without actually watching any of these new shows myself (and I assume you have not either since *Love, Victor* isn\\'t schedules to be on Hulu until June, and production of the new *Lizzie McGuire* is in hiatus), it\\'s very difficult to make judgement on if they are too mature or not.I don\\'t think they particularly care about anything older than 10 years, esp. if it\\'s not on brand Disney. If it\\'s Marvel, Fox, or Star Wars, PG-13-ish is kind of on-brand. If it\\'s Disney I think they want PG-ish max.They\\'re protecting their brands. This isn\\'t particularly out there.I think they just don\\'t want negative press for new releases, esp Disney branded ones targeted towards kids. I can see the Lizzie McGuire thing tbh. They don\\'t want to deal with angry parents who think it\\'s a kids\\'/family show if it\\'s about a 30 yo woman and her adult problems.If Hillary Duff doesn\\'t want to do a PG show, she should turn down the paycheck. She knows the deal. But she wants to have her cake and eat it, too. She wants to be on the show she\\'s already on, \"Younger\", but be the lead.Trying to revive was a bad idea since the original series fell apart over her wanting more money.Um citation needed since every document and article I\\'ve seen says it was her parents demanding more money not herIs that not what the ratings system is for? I doubt parents will see a show with a M rating, and then ignore it. Kids Mode is also there.It\\'s really really bad. Not so bad it\\'s good. Just straight up unwatchable.Gosh, I hope not haha that was a one and only time viewing for me lolIt\\'s awful. Not funny awful, just awful. I had a bootleg of it in the 90s. It\\'s probably on yt or something now.I doubt it, tbh. But stranger things have happened.It could be a rite of passage for a new generation of fans...it\\'s like when you taste or smell something horrible and you want someone else to experience it just so you can shrug at each other and agree it\\'s really bad.The rite of passage is finding the copy online on top of watching it. To be handed a copy just takes the fun out of itI had a similar problem with Netflix a while ago. I just wound up using a roku. That might work better than anything else I\\'ll recommend. the boxes cost $25-50 now, so rather than spending a weekend figuring it out, that might work better. Some of these smart TV\\'s software are honestly pretty janky.I need to know more about your setup and the settings on your tv. The sound - it\\'s coming out of the speakers/soundbar but not the headphones? Do you have a D/A converter? What\\'s your exact sound setup? Are you streaming through your SmartTv or a roku or other device? Do you have this problem in *any* other apps. Try Netflix if you have that. Also try an older live-action movie that hasn\\'t had a recent re-release. Herbie from the 1960s or something. See if there\\'s sound.Great advice, tried all!  Don’t have a D/A converter.  Sound setup is blue tooth soundbar or blue tooth headphones...  except Disney plus it’s soundbar or nothing I have sound in the app like when you change icons, but you cannot play anything with headphones connected no video no sound .... tried disconnecting S B, tried older movies they just wont work on Disney plus!  Thanks for your help ...  haven’t tried roku yet will try that next!Probably under Eastern Europe, so Late 2020-Early 2021.We don’t get Hulu so I doubt itWho knows. Maybe it\\'s not ;)It is probably a mistake. Apparently some subscribers in the Netherlands received a similar email.Some subscribers in Australia are also getting the email (we don\\'t have Hulu yet either)Beware of scams... some are VERY sophisticated. You might land in a page that *looks* like the real one. They might be stealing your credentials for then selling your account.Worst: you give your credit card # for the \"upgrade\"  and then you end up with thousands in chargesDidn\\'t think so, wonder why I got the email lol I was confusedThe Disney vault is technically still a thing albeit with a completely different use.Theaters that used to screen fox movies for special screenings find themselves unable to as Disney says they aren’t allowed, some movies are currently in limbo as they leave streaming services and haven’t been added to Disney’s offerings etc.Also, the Disney vault has a physical location. You just aren’t allowed to bring anything in with you when you enter. From the doorway it looks kind of like a small libraryNo. If they start \"vaulting\" movies off D+, that\\'s it. I (and many others) would unsub for that. I can forgive lack of original content. I know it\\'s expensive and takes time. The library, however, is why I don\\'t mind paying for the service. Start shrinking that for no reason and i can\\'t justify it going forward.No.Not at all.NopeI was promised that the vault was gone with this service. If it comes back, I will cancel my subscription in a heartbeat!i’m curious, what is his stance on the vault?I agree. It is bad enough already that some of the more obscure and unknown library content (but very interesting to Disney fans) was not made available in the Netherlands.He helped set it all up. He had a part in its creation and existence.between threes and what i’ve heard about the parks, i can’t see him being liked all that much within dune parts of the company4 devices at once. Can be installed on as many as you’d like, I believe.You can use 4 devices are once. There is a limit for the number of devices that Disney+ can be installed on and that is 10 devices. There is currently no way to remove devices if you reach 10, so just keep an eye on that.Thank youi believe it\\'s 10 devices for downloading only but unlimited devices in total? it may have changed in the last couple of months, though.Looking through previous posts through this sub on the issue, it was 10 devices that you were able to add a Disney+ account to, which is not the downloading. I cannot find anything in the Disney+ FAQ\\'s/Help pages anymore, so they may have removed that limit.I wasn\\'t entirely sure if Bobby was actually facing some feelings for his friend but that little knee bump seemed to be a moment that I\\'m Hella surprised that a Disney show would go toward. Its fair refreshing having a Disney show with a gay lead supporting character and to see that they may be having a gay main character is even more wild and amazing.Start with specifics:-\\tdevice-\\tversion (of app, or OS)-\\tinternet bandwidth -\\tseries-\\thow you try to skip-\\twhy skipping is neededYou can always select the episode you want to play without going through the previous one(s). Skipping needs memory (to buffer) which can fill up. Your device may not be capable of reading and writing to that part of memory and play video at the same time. Some series (such as \"The Mandalorian\") may cause 4k playback to overload your playback device, in which case slowing down your skipping may be your only option.The issue of not keeping track of where you left off has to do with the way your playback device tries to communicate with the servers.Press Release:  Disney+ has ordered the long-anticipated revival of the groundbreaking animated series \"The Proud Family\" which, 18 years after its Disney Channel premiere, is still beloved for its characters, stories and multilayered humor and for its messages about inclusion and cultural diversity in a smart, modern way. The new animated family sitcom \"The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder\" is currently in production at Disney Television Animation with Academy Award-winning creator/executive producer Bruce W. Smith and executive producer Ralph Farquhar, who led the original series, at the helm, reuniting them with Calvin Brown, Jr. who is co-executive producer and story editor.All previous seasons of “The Proud Family” are currently available on Disney+.  In a joint statement, Smith and Farquhar said, \"In our minds, the show never really went away, as we still had tons of stories left to tell. It\\'s the perfect time to bring back this show, and we can\\'t wait to take fans, old and new alike, on this journey with us.\" Picking up the story of its central character Penny Proud, the new series will also include her madcap family: parents Oscar and Trudy, twin siblings BeBe and CeCe, and her grandmother Suga Mama (and Puff!). Of course, it would not be \"The Proud Family\" without Penny\\'s loyal crew Dijonay Jones, LaCienega Boulevardez and Zoey Howzer, among others.Disney+ and Disney Television Animation also released concept art featuring the main characters from the upcoming series.Reprising their voice roles are: Kyla Pratt as Penny Proud, Tommy Davidson as Oscar Proud, Paula Jai Parker as Trudy Proud, Jo Marie Payton as Suga Mama, Karen Malina White as Dijonay Jones, Soleil Moon Frye as Zoey Howzer and Alisa Reyes as LaCienega Boulevardez. Cedric the Entertainer will also return as Uncle Bobby Proud. “The show’s humor and relatable stories are as relevant with audiences today as ever,” said Agnes Chu, senior vice president, Content, Disney+. “Our audiences have loved rediscovering their favorite episodes of ‘The Proud Family,’ and we’re excited Bruce, Ralph, Calvin, and the returning cast are creating new stories for their new home on Disney+.”Gary Marsh, president and chief creative officer, Disney Channels Worldwide, said, \"The genius of the original ‘Proud Family’ series was that, under the guise of a family comedy, it provided a brilliant social commentary on our life and times.  With this new series, Bruce and Ralph will once again challenge everyone to think differently about the world we share.\"Looking forward to it! I\\'ll admit that I\\'ve watched a few episodes of the original since they were uploaded to Disney+, and I loved it growing up.Wonder if they\\'ll be bringing Sticky back into the mix. If they do, I get the feeling Orlando Brown won\\'t be voicing him...Please make a 3rd season for American Dragon: Jake Long!It\\'s cool that all the original voice actors are going to be back.It\\'s a good thing that I am almost done with the original series. Though is this a reboot or a sequel? Like is Penny going to be 16 in this like she was in the movie or are they going to age her up? I noticed that BeBe and CeCe are no longer babies so is it safe to assume that this new series takes place either prior to or after the movie?my 8 yr old randomly put this on and is obsessed with it. Beats having to listen to A.N.T. Farm all day...Pls don’t drop the ball like with Lizzie! Do this iconic show justice Disney!This is great news, but can Disney start focusing on something new instead of milking nostalgia constantly? It was cool when they started retouching older IPs a few years back, but it\\'s gotten so old.I never watched the Proud family when I was little but I started watching it now as an adult. It is such a good show!Great! I am hyped for this. I recently re-watched a few of my favorite episodes. Culture Shock was *really* smartly done, especially that final twist and the wholesome message by Penny.Really? I didn’t believe it would actually come back, but I’m glad it did.Nice! Now if they only could add episode 10 of season 1 and the entire second and third seasons...Man this is amazingFun fact!: La Cienega Boulevardez and Sunset Boulevardez are named after roads, La Cienega Boulevard and Sunset Boulevard, in Los Angeles County. Kind of a revelation for me when I first saw the street names and put it together.They released this information today to distract from the bad press on Love Victor.honest, im hooked.Pretty sure hashtags don’t work like that on reddit.SUGA MAMAS BACK AAAAHHHHHH SHE IS A QUEEN👑👑👑I\\'m ready to be disappointed. When has this ever worked?Can you bring back something good instead?Boooooo!The show literally no one asked for. I was always bored to tears when this show came on.smh they cancel lizzie but bring this sub par show back. And STILL dont have family matters on the platform!This is gonna be a line probably said every episode.“We are the Proud family, black and proud.”Disney gonna push that hard, they need more African American moneyI rewatched this entire series and That’s So Raven a few months ago and they still hold up for me! Maybe I’m childish though, lol. Oscar and Bobby are hilarious.Or they can cut his character out and replace with a new one to represent Sticky. Just saying that it could be possible... or pull off a Jeremy there (since Mitchell Musso, his VA, was spared thanks to Phineas and Ferb\\'s creators despite this charges forcing him out of Disney).Honestly, I think it should get a same VAs reboot. They meddled so much with that show...Speaking of which, you think Juniper Lee & Jake Long allegedly copied each other since both respective creators were formerly from MTV?It says \"revival\", so my guess is a \"Season 3-ish\".It\\'ll undoubtedly be the Proud Family, but it\\'ll \"comicbook time\" to 2020. I expect the animation will be slightly different too.Are you by any chance not in America as I can’t find ANT Farm on the NA site?But the Ducktales reboot was good.The Proud Family can still be fresh in the \\'10s and \\'20s. The whole show provided social commentary for the \\'00s. It\\'s one of the few shows, besides Rocko\\'s Modern Life, that could still produce new stories and concepts for a modern audience.Catering to nostalgia and expanding on pre-existing properties and stories has kind of been Disney\\'s bread-and-butter for most of the company\\'s existence. New IPs would be great, but I unfortunately don\\'t see that practice going away any time soon.They literally have a new movie out right now.You. *You* didn’t ask for it to come back. Many others did, so deal with it.How is this show subpar? Just because *You* don’t care for it, doesn’t mean it is. And also, Family Matters is a Warner Bros property and it’s on Hulu.Have you ever seen an episode?just make sure to change the art againWhat it is \"Vas\" ? And why should there be a reboot and not a sequel?Your comment? [Click here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/dwkh1i/where_is_amercian_dragon_jake_long/f7n7c5m?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)I don\\'t know or maybe not, they didn\\'t copy each other!We have a preview of what the animation is going to look like and I wonder if Penny is going to be 16 like in the movie or if they\\'ll age her up to 17 or so.I am in US, it\\'s not on disney+ but stupidly I found a download for it and its on 24/7 b/c of my 8 yr old.Huey, Louie & Dewey have distinct personalities, and the reboot finally ***WEAPONIZED*** Donald\\'s rage.Do you have any idea how happy I am about that last part?Not even close if you do the math. If we assume to start with steamboat willie in 1928, then that leaves us with 92 years to play with.So we had silly symphonies, the mickey, donald, goofy etc cartoon shorts that proceeded for the next few decades or so along with any feature length film in theaters such as snow white, robin hood, sleeping beauty etc.Going all the way to the early 80s around the time when we got the Disney Channel and by extension through other channels at the time, the Disney afternoon.So unless we count reruns of those shorts or films recirculating through theaters until they were basically forced to put them out on vhs, that means that a good 50 years or roughly half the companies lifetime had been spent coming out with new ideas and putting out rerruns as was the norm back then.As we delve into the disney afternoon and renaissance era, we see a HUGE explosion in creative talent.But the beginning of the end starts in the mid 90s with the advent of pixar and toy story. More than 60 years into the companies lifetime just to keep track. After that, Disney started to waver.The masses saw something new and shiny (much to the chagrin of many who preferred traditional 2D animation) and so towards the late 90s and early 2000s, a new direction was unfortunately on its way. 70 years to keep track again.Direct to video movies. From here we see many properties such as the little mermaid, mulan, lion king and more recycled to the masses with a significantly lower budget in hopes of cashing in on the name.So given it’s 2020 and those movies were in the late 90s to early 00s, that means only 20 years or so have churned out this “catering to nostalgia” as you put it.There have been plenty of shorts back before the disney afternoon that reused characters but they were never catering to any sort of nostalgia but rather simply bringing new stories featuring those characters.So just to be clear, Disney hasn’t been doing this for as long as people think and while I personally don’t like the direction they’re going in, it’s hard to imagine them sticking to this formula en mass for much longer given the impact it will have long term to their reputation.What is it?No. No they did not. I’m sure there are dozens who asked for it back. That’s all. Not hundreds. Not thousands. Dozens.Hell yea! I grew up watching this show. Loved it! I can imagine them pushing that agenda though>ust make sure to change the art againI like the art style of the 2nd season! And I want it to be present in the 3rd season!Voice Actors. The story arcs for the Crystal Skulls was going to be S2 and the Dark Dragon S3, but then they got combined together AND S2 lost 13 episodes on top of that, and the art reboot kind made referencing the 1st season \"talk only\" - they didn\\'t every redraw anything from it aside from the dance photo and Jake and Rose. I just feel that, yeah it was good, but it has even more potential that\\'ll be realized if it gets to grow with being squished at the end of it\\'s run...Yep! That show has SO many amazing loose ends. There\\'s even more I could add to that honestly!I do stand by that each show is it\\'s own thing, despite \"similarities\". JL\\'s strength is the character relationships while Juniper\\'s more slightly towards Chinese culture.That aside, anytime there\\'s a comparison between the two, no one brought up that Jeff Goode & Judd Winick, respectively of Jake Long & Juniper Lee, were formerly MTV alumni.Whatever stresses Oscar out the most I\\'m hoping 0:)Donald’s video games like Quackshot weaponized it, too, though he had to consume peppers before flying into a rage lolI mean a lot of Disney’s classic movies are based off of pre-existing legends, tales, comics, folklore. I think that’s what they meant.Onward. It stars Chris Pratt and Tom Holland, they voice brothers looking for their dad.Whatever helps you sleep at night... Doesn’t mean you’re right based on your dislike of the show.What agenda?Please noBut I think it\\'s better to have a 3rd season, not a reboot! :D  But it\\'s still not up to us to decide. Disney + solves everything here!Wow =)Come on, add something else! =)Really? \"Jake Long & Juniper Lee, were formerly MTV alumni\"Oh I loved that game! Never managed to complete it.Oh, I didn\\'t know that was out already. Cool.My guess is \"black people are people too\" which is, not bad.You don\\'t have any taste, the artistic style of the 1st season looks child! The artistic style of the 2nd season looks better!Going off Mr. Long being a werewolf:* Jake\\'s Aunt *knew* she was dating a troll, but she and her brother are much better at keeping being werewolves secret than Jake, Haley and Lao-Shi are at keeping being dragons secret.   * They also knew the family were dragons - their hearing is on par with a wolfs, so...  * An easy one - Jake\\'s dad being a werewolf is how he saved Jake all those times. * it\\'s why he asks where their clothes go when they transform!The ghost episode showed - there are still more magical creatures to be found, if you count ghosts as magical creatures.I meant creators of JL & JL respectively.Jeff Goode worked on MTV Undressed before he created Jake Long.Judd Winick is more high profile, formerly a Real World cast member before he wrote for comics such as Barry Ween & various Marvel stuff. Later, he created Juniper Lee.Somewhere, somehow,  JG & JW must\\'ve glanced at each other\\'s thumbnails during their MTV tenure and went off from there.I remember feeling accomplished when I beat it, and there were a lot of plunger used!! This was back around 1995 on Genesis!!Dude the second season is universally hated. Clearly you have bad taste. But hey it\\'s ok not everyone can have good taste and you\\'re free to like bad things..that doesnt make them good however.Jake\\'s father is a werewolf? :D  Really?Understood, thanks for the information!It\\'s no use talking to you! Rose in the 2nd season looks more beautiful than in the first! And not to mention the rest of the characters.Apparently, that was an idea that was floating around in the writers room. He\\'d go on a \"business trip\" once and month - and the joke was the family never put 2+2 together. You can kinda see it though - Grandpa not liking a werewolf makes more sense, and traditionally werewolves are hunted much more than dragons, they\\'d be better at hiding.You\\'re welcome.Sorry for any miscommunication.Got it :DNothing =)Ah they\\'re finally showing the GotG collection. I\\'ve noticed it existed for a while now, but it always redirected me back to the homepage until now.There should be an Infinity Saga collection lmaoWhere\\'s the Winnie The Pooh collection?what happened to the Simpsons collection?Why is there a gotg collection? There\\'s only two moviesReally, when did you notice it before? Was there a way to search for the collection specifically or was it somewhere on the app?I highly agree!! That or an MCU collection with each phaseIt’s currently only available on kids’ profiles.Y\\'know, I was asking the same thing. You\\'d figure there\\'d be a \"Winnie the Pooh and Friends\" Collection in there tooThere’s also the animated series and a few animated shortsSeptember probably. I use Disney+ in my browser mainly and I just tried a couple different URLs for collections to see if they existed or not.Not if you type in the url for it on a regular accountOh still not really that much.Huh, didn\\'t think to check URLs by browser. Were there any other ones that aren\\'t currently visible or are they all up on there already?True, could say the same about the Pirates of the Caribbean and Herbie Collections, which also shares a total amount of 5 items in each oneI only tried a couple, so yeahI can answer for a few of those: ducktales and darkwing exist in what\\'s known in a greater context as the \"disney Ducks universe\", a collection of original stories going on across america and europe for decades. Its a ridiculously huge multimedia franchise that\\'s won awards, acclaim, sales and its own legendary status in many countries beyond mickey mouse himelf.The current ducktales makers are following that as a template and incorporating tailspin to boot. Disney ducks wouldnt incorporate into zootopia; its too big now. Zootopia would incorporate into disney ducks.What about those other properties? I can see them happening within the Duck-verse:Robin Hood, Mr. Toad, Gummiebears & SOS could have just happened in the past. Mighty Ducks, Talespin & Rescue Rangers are happening in current time but elsewhere.Oh I did not know that Ducks-verse was a thing.. are Mickey, Goofy, etc. in this universe?I think it really depends on who\\'s running both universes: right now, Frank Angones(who runs ducktales) is doing such a cool extended universe setup that he ought to do whatever he wants first. The only other person running something like that is whoever is running legend of the three caballeros(which is a great show, but entirely disconnected from ducktales. Its not connecting to anything beyond a few cameos).I could see rebecca sugar doing something now that steven universe is over, and she plays well in others franchises after her work on adventure time. Brian Konietzko who ran avatar could do it too after the end of the avatar netflix show, but i dunno if hed play nice with disney, not after how nick played games with korra\\'s release.Edit: just so you know, talespin characters are being used by ducktales at the moment.Selectively. It really depends on in there\\'s a story that needs them, but theyre almost never the main hero of it. In the ducks universe, the 3 caballeros is canon, characters from mickey mouse cartoons like the shadow blot or the mad doctor will just appear, and the story telling is really great:[https://static.fjcdn.com/large/pictures/87/b4/87b4ef_4931812.jpg] (this page from the life and times of scrooge mcduck has him plain out stating why the nephews including Donald are so important to him)I wish they would make it available with a disclaimer at the start. Something like:>Song of the South depicts some ethnic and racial prejudices that were once commonplace in American society. Such depictions were wrong then and are wrong today. This film has been presented in its full and original format. Prejudice in all of its forms is wrong - however it would be an even greater wrong to pretend that these prejudices never existed. Thank you.No, I personally don\\'t agree with this censorship. The movie itself isn\\'t that bad at all especially considering the time period. The only thing you do by simply \\'forbidding\\' it is actually letting people forget this and pretend this never happened at all. Imho not the greatest way to educate people and/or keeping the memory alive.Whoopy Goldberg has already mentioned she wanted this movie to be distributed normally and she would be more than happy to present an \\'introduction\\'/disclaimer at the start. That would be the way to go forward.They need to just bite the bullet and release it with a disclaimer.  Then people could watch it and see what it\\'s about and move on.  The longer they keep it hidden, the bigger and more important it becomes in people\\'s imaginations.It\\'s no more racist than Peter Pan.Couldn’t they remake the movie in a realistic and respectful way? From the black character’s perspectives? I feel like this would be a much better opportunity for sharing some of the concerns of the film, instead of sweeping it under the rug.Like they did with the older looney tunes cartoons.That\\'s a low bar.That pretends the original never happened thoThey did the same for Tom and Jerry as well right?I know, but for some reason, it always gets a pass.I mean that’s happening anyway.Yes indeedFairIt was already on the platform as part 1 and 2 but still happy about it.Yes, it is a hit and miss for me. Xbox and iOS. Usually if watch till it brings up the “recommendation to watch” then back out, it will disappear. I’ve also noticed cross platform issues. Finishing a  show with 5 mins left on iPad and it shows up on Xbox as 5 mins left. But on iPad it is gone.This is my childhood wowI forgot this show existed until I saw this post.y’all better go stream and support my uncles😤Love![deleted]Watching Disney+ on a computer isn\\'t remotely outdated.Laptops with DD Headphones? Desktop computers with 5.1 speakers?I used HTPC purely because it ensures understanding by trolls such as yourself that I understand the fundamentals of requiring proper Dolby Digital hardware to leverage signal output.Using a windows machine (or Apple Mac mini, et Ala) to stream media is not even slightly an outdated technology.Furthermore, by creating an Xbox application they already did the work, they just were shortsighted in not porting the minor changes to the windows store.Apparently there was a 2nd season in 2018 but for some reason it\\'s being held back. Hopefully they put it soon. I don\\'t like the idea of completed shows not being dropped all at once. There is no rhyme or reason to this. For Imagination Movers all 3 seasons came at once, but Randy Cunningham, for example, only added its 1st season. Not sure I get the point there.Another title that\\'s never been released in the US before, yet gets brushed under the rug with little fanfare.And now we wait for other shows that are also collabs with Toei, the company the made this show, esp. its prequel Marvel Disk Wars.What about the next avengers?Randy has both seasons available at least in the US. I\\'m staring at them right now.sad, isn\\'t it? this is the crap they should be shouting! NEW CONTENT. Let\\'s advertise to people the new global adds!Yeah I\\'d think those would be coming too now.Pretty sure Lionsgate owns that movie.Uh isn’t that Darby o’gill and the little people? Did they change the name or something?Did it get removed already?Removed ONE DAY LATER.And of course this was not made available in the Netherlands... reading about all of the additions the US gets and we miss out on is getting more and more disappointing and annoying.Of all the things that were added today we only got the least interesting one (Shop Class). Apparently Disney+ sees its Dutch viewers as second class, which makes me wonder why we have to pay the full amount.I hope that things pick up when the rest of Europe gets access, but I am not holding my breath. I am a huge Disney fan, but Disney+ is turning into a major disappointment this way.Read the description of it. It\\'s a behind the scenes look of Darby O\\' Gill and the Little People with Walt Disney and Pat O\\'Brien.Good catch, but u/Elfdemon is correct!Yes. Wtf. It was up ONE DAY.Ah I did not look deeper thank you.No problem, we all make small mistakes like that :)I thought maybe they changed the name since the term Little people isn’t appropriateCool. Nice to see some Anime on the service.I\\'m glad that this finally happened.I\\'ve noticed with this series as well as the previous Marvel anime series, they tend to like to replace Black Widow with Wasp in the main roster. Is Wasp one of the more popular characters in Japan. It\\'s interesting.Thanks, i\\'ll tell my kidsHah bro i beat you to these posts by 1 hour! However I was not aware Viking Women was new . Cool! Guess I\\'m not the only Vampire though.Wasp was a founding avenger in the comics. Black Widow was only a founder in the MCU and Ultimates alternate universe (which I believe the MCU is heavily based off). This is also why Wasp was a member instead in Avengers Earth\\'s Mightiest HeroesYeah, I know but Congrats to you anyway! Also, I’m glad that other users besides myself have also screenshot the show, movie, or episode’s interface for whenever something new is added to Disney+!Ah, thanks for the info!Oh geez. Here we go again. Episodes are out of order.Season 1 finale is in wrong spot. It appears they sorted the show by Production order, but this means the FINALE is not the finale.  Episode 27 needs to be moved to between 23 and 24 so that 25 is the finale, as intended. I have already submitted this to [help.disneyplus.com](https://help.disneyplus.com) / give feedback / episodes missing or out of order. I hope you guys will too... It\\'s also missing episode 26 entirely.How! How does this keep happening! This is freakin Disney! Netflix at most has like 2 or so shows out of order but half of Disney’s catalogue refused to give us airing order!I’m honestly considering canceling after my year is up.Actually, I think I can explain that:1. There\\'s only 26 half hours produced so far, they accidentally typed 27 instead of 26. There is no episode 27.2. \"The De Vil Wears Puppies\" did air last internationally, but \"Puppy Dreams\" comes after it in production order.yes, but shows are added in air order usually, not production order. this makes no sense that they did it here. the shows that SHOULD be ordered by production order aren\\'t. like lizzie mcguire.This is really disappointing.Man, what’s going on with some of these originals.Knew it, we\\'ve barely heard anythingThat\\'s pretty disappointing. In general I think Disney+ could have benefited from a high quality original animated series closer to launch. By original I don\\'t necessary mean original IP, though that would be a plus, but rather that it\\'s a Disney+ exclusive, not something that airs elsewhere then shows up on Disney+ when it ends. Something along the lines of Gravity Falls, Star Vs., Amphibia, or Owl House would have been nice to have as an official Disney+ show and seems like a big omission to not have any animated originals for almost 2 years. Monsters At Work could have filled that niche, but spring 2021 is pretty far away. Simulcasting one of the Disney Channel or XD shows, like the aforementioned The Owl House, might have worked too.Makes sense really. Never expected it to come out in March.I was hoping they would reveal the trailer and release date for this show and I was expecting it to come out by Summer but oh well :(.Awww nooo!!March may have been too soon. But to go from March to Spring next year is insane.In the US you couldn\\'t download the app until launch day.Oh ok then thanks. Still my model isn\\'t listed despite getting it in 2016 and it running Web OS 3. Hoping I can get it. I have a PS4 anyway as well as Firestick but I just think it\\'s more convenient to use have it part of smart hub.You can change the quality settings in your app settings, but that’s not just going to magically change the files you’ve already downloaded. You’ll have to delete and redownload those titles.I was excited to watch this with my boys of 8 and 11 but I was underwhelmed. The production seemed very low budget and I would have liked to see the kids guided to making something much better. They should have had the Imagineers much more involved (“Imagineering Class”). Justin Long was also way too low key, he seemed bored.I’ve really enjoyed this series with my son (6 years old).The designs through the first two episodes are both realistic and creative. I like the pure competition aspect and the authenticity that these are things any group of kids could conceive and create. The emphasis on execution and the adjustments that need to be made in order to hit a deadline is very educational. The judging has been very good through the first 2 episodes. I think they’re doing well to emphasis quality of execution rather than getting swayed by complication in designs.I’ll agree with other comments that Justin Long doesn’t fit as a host. His humor so far seems forced and doesn’t add anything to the program. I’d think Adam Savage or any of the build team members from MythBusters would be a better fit.Yeah. Maybe the teams could have included an Imagineer. Or maybe you have a token that you can use to get 15 minutes with an Imagineer but you loose 15 minutes of build time or whatever. Let them work in an Imagineering lab, winning design gets installed on a WD property, everyone who participates gets something (class at Dworld or Dland? Money/tools for shop teacher’s class?). Very low production, low stakes and low energy from host. Too bad.march 11 at walt disney studios, includes q&a with director. tickets are available starting march 2 at 10 am pst, they are free, but you must be a d23 gold or family member to request tickets.If you or your kids are under 12 or you are nostalgic, yes. Otherwise, no.I signed up last night. I think it\\'s a decent price and there\\'s plenty on there to keep me entertained and more shows on the way.I found this list of what\\'s going to be available if that\\'s any help - https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/disney-plus-movie-tv-show-avengers-marvel-star-wars-uk-release-trailer-a9110286.htmlI hope there\\'s a lot of variety too. I\\'m mostly in it for the cartoons, so I really want Bonkers to be available to the UK, since there\\'s not even any DVDs of that show.I went to pre-order today and after creating my password I got a \\'this service is not available in your region yet\\' message. I am able to log in but get sent straight to a \\'service unavailable\\' page. It\\'s as if they don\\'t want my money!I checked the link you posted upthread and unless I misread, the monthly cost is only four dollars and ninety nine cents per month, not forty nine ninety nine. If you already subscribe to Disney Life or you’re a huge Disney fanatic, then yes, paying around five dollars a month for their vast back catalogue of content is worth it. Content will vary by country because of pre-existing licensing deals but I think the UK is slated to have a pretty full slate at launch.All these questions can be answered by YOU, by using the free 7 day trial.Thank you so much this is what I was looking for. Thanks 😊Damn it.I just want to know more about it before I invest my money in to it. I mean 49.99 is good for a year round package but I want to know what the per month cost will be to give myself something to compare it too. Also I have questions about content.How can it be answered by me, when the service isnt even live yet. Its a one time offer, so....No problem!https://help.disneyplus.com/csp?id=csp_article_content&sys_kb_id=114464d51b8fc8d4b8651f861a4bcba4Also, 49.99/12 for monthly cost?When it\\'s live you get a free 7 day trial. 🤦🏻\\u200d♂\\u200dYeah it\\'s a limited deal f you preorder for a year instead of the usual £69.99What after spending 49.99 🤦 Id perfer to have an idea before I part with cash 😂It’s actually 59.99, not that great a deal tbhbruh.When it GOES live.It\\'s £10 off. Better than nothingThe offer ends before it goes live. Goes live on the 24th of March and offer ends on the 23rdDon’t forget Percy Jackson!You\\'re right about the out of order towards the end, but 27 should actually be 26.There is no 27, because apparently they only made 26 episodes (or 52 11 minute half hour episodes)I mean, just look what happened to Girl Meets World. The show runner, forget his name, pushed for more mature themes like Boy Meets World had but disney kept watering it down. GMW had such wasted potential and it\\'s so sad that Disney Channel filtered itim not surprised, most disney shows from the 90\\'s to roughly 04 are more adult than what disney/d+ allows today for new stuffSo bummed about this I hope it still happensThis is sad. It\\'s been stated repeatedly that this sequel will do right by the fans, but everyone who grew up with this show is now in their 20\\'s and 30\\'s. We don\\'t want a lowest-common-denominator kiddie show. Disney Channel has enough cheesefests full of precocious children. We want to see the characters we loved as they enter a new chapter of their lives.We don\\'t need an R-rated Lizzie, but there are plenty of PG-13 properties on Disney+...in Avengers: Infinity War, half the universe dies. In The Simpsons Movie, they straight up show Bart\\'s dick. There are movies like 10 Things I Hate About You that feature sexual humour and characters getting drunk, which I imagine is as far as new eps of LM would go. Why can\\'t Lizzie explore certain mature themes? I\\'m sure there\\'s a way to make this entertaining for adults and teens alike, without watering it down or going too far. Something thematically akin to the later seasons of Boy Meets World is what I\\'m envisioning (and they\\'re all on D+). I\\'m really hoping this project still happens.Move it to Hulu, then? Idk.Not that surprising after what they did to Andi Mack. They let Cyrus come out as gay and even say the words \"I\\'m gay\" but they couldn\\'t let him have a relationship. Joshua Rush and Luke Mullen have said they were told to tone down their scenes together because they were acting \"too gay.\" I\\'m honestly surprised Terri Minsky didn\\'t quit that show too.Dang this and the Obi-Wan series running into issues? :(Dont know anything about and have no interest in Lizzie McGuire but I feel like if Disney doesn\\'t loosen the \"too adult\" restrictions a little bit the service is going to struggle in the long term.It should be moved to Hulu. None of us want a bland, watered down series. Maybe we should throw a tantrum to Disney like the Love, Simon opposers. I was looking forward to this so much. Really hoping it gets moved to Hulu, but I doubt the money-hungry Disney Corp will sell the series sequel of one of their top grossing shows.I wish Lalaine was part of it.If I didn\\'t have kids I would\\'ve dropped Disney+ already. The only thing I\\'ve watched on there is The Mandalorian and Even Stevens. I was low key excited about Lizzie and The Mighty Ducks revivals, but it\\'s looking like they will be watered down versions ala Girl Meets World, which was a massive disappointment.D+ is doomed to fail unless they get rid of their asinine family friendly restrictions, just have an age code for parents and give us everything, like King of the HillI\\'m pretty close to ditching D+ for a while, maybe until the Marvel shows start coming out. All that\\'s on now is Clone Wars, which doesn\\'t really justify $7/month imo.Oh no! I was so excited to see the new show!But you can make adult and children accounts on there and they have splash... which (awesome) but also has John candy being a bit... adultI truly believe this is her saving face. I just don\\'t see how this would be \"too adult\".  The far more likely scenario is they didn\\'t/couldn\\'t come up with a very compelling story for the revival.yeah well, that\\'s what Hulu is for.At least this time it wasn\\'t Hillary Duff\\'s mother\\'s fault. She played hard ball with Eisner years ago to continue it and he gave her a deadline, she came after the deadline, and Eisner being him self said no.did a nostalgia rewatch of BMW after mando wrapped- such a great teen show. Tried some of the GMW episodes that featured the older cast members, and it really was night and day.which sucks, they did great casting with the two girl leads. alot of charisma, chemistry, and energyEven their shows from the early 2000s were more adult than the shows they pump out now. I remember watching that episode of That\\'s So Raven where Chelsea gets hired instead of Raven because of racism and I loved it because it was so relevant. Nowadays, Disney would never release an episode like that for any of their \\'kid\\' shows.I enjoyed Girl Meets World for what it was. I agree it could have been better though. Once the characters had moved on to high school, the producers should\\'ve followed suit and moved the show to Freeform.I luckily don\\'t have to pay for mine, otherwise I\\'d be cancelling too. Andi Mack barely has any episodes because of someone apparently being a child molester and the only other shows I\\'m into I can find elsewhere.There\\'s a few movies I\\'m kind of interested in between shows: I liked Togo; kind of interested in secret society of second born royals; and some of the hidden gems like \"Waking Sleping Beauty\" are really interesting; but there\\'s really not enough.That said, the Big Hero 6 series is something I\\'m watching in between Clone Wars, so that\\'s okay.they started and then stalled production and booted the show runner lol. I don’t think she’s lying lol...Hillary Duff posted an article on her Instagram story that was about Disney dropping the Love Simon TV show because it wasn’t “family friendly” enough, and she wrote something like “sounds familiar” above the article.Well the people who watched the show as kids are adults now so it was most definitely going to try to appeal to people who have seen the show.>I just don\\'t see how this would be \"too adult\".Agreed.  No way it approaches Mandalorian or the Simpsons, this is just sour grapes.How them boots taste thoHulu is only in the United States if i’m correctI will say i have hopes of this style returning more as I\\'ve been watching Diary of a Future President with my daughter. A recent episode showed a character being bullied for the tidled n in his Mexican last name. Racism towards Hispanics is so high right now, it felt very relevant. The show also (lightly) deals with themes of grief, same sex relationships, effects of new relationships with children involved...even has some light swearing. It\\'s a refreshing change to the plastic laugh track change they\\'ve been doling out for years.I enjoyed Waking Sleeping Beauty as well.It\\'s just as likely they didnt like the the quality of the show being produced, but hiding behind this excuse sounds better.I\\'m aware. I\\'m saying I don\\'t buy that as the reason they halted the Lizzie revival. I think that\\'s her using the Love, Simon move as an excuse for her and her co-producers failings to create a better show with the Lizzie revival.  But claiming they wanted the Lizzie revival to be more mature plays better than \"our idea was stupid and Disney ultimately didn\\'t like\"The show was ultimately just about Lizzie having a teenage crush on Ethan but inevitably realizing she likes Gordo.  The show/movie pretty much had no other plot to speak of.   What adult themes could there have been? Do fans of that show want sex, drugs, and violence in the revival?That\\'s a problem that Disney will have to fix.Agreed, but the big difference is that Diary of a Future President wasn\\'t made by Disney. It\\'s a CBS show that they bought after CBS passed on it.100% not true.And your comments play more like a Disney lapdog who can’t fathom Disney being a bit of a prude. But what do I knowDeath, divorce, dealing with racism could have been a few but that’s just a guess... you clearly know more about both shows than all the people involved sorry to waste your time.They\\'re 100% prude. Always have been, always will be. You can\\'t make a leopard change it\\'s spots.  My point is, Hillary Duff and her crew knew that going in. They pitched a family friendly show and Disney greenlit it. Maybe they tried to change things after that but there\\'s no way Disney greenlit a \"mature\" show in the first place.Death/grieving and divorce would not be an issue on Disney+. They literally made a Disney channel movie about racism called \"Color of friendship\", which is now on Disney+. So far the only things Disney seems gun-shy about is sex, drugs and overt homosexuality. It\\'s hard to believe the Lizzie revival centered around these things.If I remember correctly the pitch was a 30 yr old Lizzie in NYC. Not sure how you can conceive family-friendly from that.It supposedly had a gay characterInfidelity?From what I\\'ve heard, it seems that Lizzie discovers her husband is cheating on her.Because it\\'s a sequel to a Disney channel show that was family friendly.  This is like if you expected Fuller House to be adult oriented.They managed to do it with Raven\\'s Home and Girl Meets World.It\\'s really too early to tell how the Lizzie reboot will turn out.The high School musical show has a gay character....actually it was. At least it was a bit more adult than the original. It grew with the audience.A gay couple, in fact . . . who were never shown kissing, while the straight couples were.Do you think that because Disney has a show with a gay character and a movie about racism, those things can\\'t ever be done again by Disney? Because that\\'s the only implication of what you\\'re saying here.Gay characters that had most of their scenes cut, but they still released the stills from them, making people excited about them, only to be left there with almost nothing.I do think that\\'s why they postponed Lizzie McGuire and why Love, Simon was moved to Hulu. It\\'s fear of what homophobics will do to Disney, and even maybe homophobia in Disney. I mostly think they are scared by the reactions of a TV show with a gay couple as the leads (talking about Love, Victor), and maybe even why it\\'s happening with Lizzy.Now this is just crazy. Nothing about Fuller House is adult oriented. The lead actress is a devout Christian [who doesn\\'t even like filming kissing scenes](https://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/09/26/christian-actress-candace-cameron-bure-reveals-why-she-doesnt-like-kissing-men-on-tv-in-movies)There\\'s numerous dance numbers and hugging, tho.I\\'m arguing the opposite, that they wouldn\\'t shy away from them.Agreed not fan of the originals so far, aside from Mando>A better way I think the show could\\'ve been done, is to have each episode start with adult Elena and have her face a problem during her presidency. There used to be a CW show in the mid 2000s called Jack and Bobby that took this approach with a very similar premise. The guy who worked on that show is Greg Berlanti, who\\'s the head of their current run of Superhero shows and Riverdale universe(katy keen, sabrina). Diary of A Future president was initially pitched to them, so I think that they had to avoid stepping on that show\\'s toes where possible.>Another thing is, in the most recent episode (6), the thing with Gabi\\'s hotel lawsuit is completely dropped. Why start a plot line if you\\'ll abandon it later? Even for the time it\\'s in the show, it\\'s more of s B plotline.I hate to be that guy because I like a lot of Disney Channel stuff, but the show screams Disney Channel writing. And Disney Channel has produced a lot of great stuff(hell, I\\'ve started binging BH6 The Series). But it\\'s not going to hit a theme like lawsuits; it\\'s more just to prove how adult the character can be. I think they wrote the plot into a corner and realized that the \"serious moments with funny reactions\" style they were going for wasn\\'t going to jive, so they threw it out. Disney Channel does that a lot(Girl Meets World when they couldn\\'t do something would just forget about it-Farkle\\'s Character Development in season 1)>My last thing is that I\\'m just not that invested in the show. With High School Musical the Musical the Series, I was always waiting for Friday, excited to see what\\'s gonna happen next. With this, I actually forget it\\'s on sometimes and find myself realising on Monday that there\\'s a new episode of it out. I know that entertainment is subjective, but that can\\'t be good for any show.Again, I think this has to do with Disney+ not understanding what they want their original shows to be: There\\'s stuff where you just know they made it for adults(Encore,Mando, Togo) but a lot of stuff just seems like Disney Channel midseason replacements for shows that didn\\'t get canceled. And while national geographic is pumping out shows for D+, Disney doesn\\'t seem to appreciate that it\\'s not a broad appeal of adults who want to watch Jeff Goldblum lick ice cream(no offense Jeff. Uh, you\\'re really... engaging. But I... I don\\'t think it\\'s for me every week.).And the thing is that shows like Diary of A Future President should be on Disney Channel. They shouldn\\'t be advertised next to The Simpsons or Star Wars. Shows where the audience is just aging out of the Disney Channel Demographic should be on Disney+, like an Andi Mack continuation for example. But based on the news this week, I don\\'t think Disney gets that and it\\'s weird.Hey, as long as I can keep watching ad free star wars I\\'m cool.What country are you in?  What happens when you go to disneyplus.com?I disabled all adblockers and was able to sign up and afterwards enabled and was able to sign in without issue.That error code means you have to assassinate a few Jedi before they\\'ll let you sign up.I have the same problem but i\\'m from San Marino, near Italy.What can i do? i disable all adblocker but nothingDon’t laugh but how I disable adblockers and where? I have a MacBookI am in the US. On dinseyplus.com neither of the sign up links work just the pop up is displayed. I signed up on my TV so I am not sure if this is still the case.I got it to work if I did it through my TV but not on my computer but thank you for he reply! :)Haha I will get right to it!Just curious, on your tv did you download the app or went to the website on the tv browser?It was through the app on my TVI\\'m not sure how to browse the web on my TVAwesome, good to know. Many thanksNice! Now if they only could add episode 10 of season 1 and the entire second season...Watch them fire the showrunner and move this to Hulu too lol. I\\'m not even joking - it\\'s a show about a black family in 2020. You know Disney is gonna cut this off at the knees and try to turn it into bland milquetoast if the showrunners try to do anything controversial.Don’t know about that. They tend to leave animated stuff to do their thing cause of (a way too lengthy discussion I’m not in the mood for) the masses tendencies to ignore it. So we get shows like gravity falls and amphibia that can be ridiculously weird and ~~sometimes~~ always have a can they do that in a show kids watch moment every five minutes.For those unfamiliar or just learned about this series, 101 Dalmatian Street takes place in a modern setting and is set years after the events of the original film. The series itself gained a lot of advertisement leading up to it\\'s UK premiere in March 2019 (a preview was shown on December 2018). Passion Pictures even announced on teaming up with the series last Spring. The series was first revealed in the Summer of 2018.Currently the series just wrapped up it\\'s first Season in the UK this year. Also the series won\\'t get redubbed and keep it\\'s original UK audio. Plus it\\'s a co-production between the UK and Canada.YAY!!!!!are you sure about that? because i\\'m pretty sure that none of Disney\\'s official social media pages have said nothing about this...101 Dalmation Street is now OUT on D+!!!&#x200B; [https://www.disneyplus.com/series/101-dalmatian-street/4FuQufaZQMGH](https://www.disneyplus.com/series/101-dalmatian-street/4FuQufaZQMGH)Actually this is only a **rumor** and no actual site or Disney social media confirmed this, only an actor and the studio behind the show.No February list has this show either.People have tried to ask the Disney Plus twitter accounts but they apparently don\\'t care about answering those type of questions anymore.Hope this one will come to the Netherlands as well! It is extremely annoying that the US is the only market for which additions are announced.Seems unlikely unless Disney does a surprise drop. This has not been confirmed by Disney.How common is redubbing between British and American versions of cartoons or other productions?[Jack Binstead (who is voicing a character in the series) revealed the release date for the U.S. and Canada.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EO_w96_XsAAWsro?format=jpg&name=small)Yay! It didn\\'t show up for me at first when searching for it but now it does. It\\'s weird that they didn\\'t officially announce it beforehandIt\\'s not a rumor, it\\'s actually on Disney+.Well, I guess it was surprise dropped :)Reminds me of how \"The Legends Of The Three Caballeros\" was suddenly dropped on the DisneyLife app in the Philippians without any announcement. Western fans weren\\'t aware of the series until somebody created screenshots that were posted on Tumblr (eventually the episodes were uploaded on Youtube). Didn\\'t help that very little is known behind the production of the series. Except that this series was made before the Ducktales reboot was developed.It\\'s been common for a while now, I remember growing up with the American dub of Bob the Builder that aired on Nick Jr. Once it moved to PBS Kids, it decided to use the original British/UK audio. American/Canadian animated shows such as Powerpuff Girls and Arthur also gained British dubs but are difficult to find.Problem with that is that there is still no actual confirmation from anything Disney social, not even February lists have the show on that date.Same with \"The Legend of The Three Caballeros\".I’m super surprised but very happy! Why wouldn’t they want to promote this before hand?!?Honestly here’s hoping it comes tomorrow. I just feel like this is a show Disney would want to promote before hand.Interesting, thanks!Check Disney+ today, it actually arrived.Can\\'t say for certain but a ton of people were introduced to the Three Caballeros series the same way so they might be doing a similar method.It\\'s very strange, Disney\\'s been very quiet about this show\\'s in the U.S. for over a year. Meanwhile, it\\'s very widespread in the UK.And it\\'s actually out!Sounds like an iOS issue. Storage maybe? Who knows.I have 150+ GB available so I don’t think it’s a storage issueInternet then.Even for a download? I have 23 mbpsHow much free space is left on your device?More than 150 gbThat eliminates insufficient memory.None we don\\'t need unnecessary sequels. Other than inside out to see more development on Riley and her aging as well as how her emotions change. But it\\'s too late now, they\\'ve said that they\\'re no longer doing sequels.What, do you *want* to return to the days of crappy soulless cash-ins?Yeah, save sequels for stories that naturally lend themselves to it.  Now animated series, that’s a whole different ballgame, which Aladdin played quite well.Tangled already got a sequel with Tangled: The Series.  As for the rest, I think only Inside Out could have a good sequel with Riley going through puberty/teenage years.  I actually thought that is what the ending of the first movie was hinting at.I think all of these work best as standalones, *except* maybe \"A Bug\\'s Life\" could have a sequel... Hmmm.It\\'s not a matter of what we need... I don\\'t remember there ever being any demand for a 2nd Beauty and The Beast.. but we got it in video. Disney + seems like a good place to mote more content like this... Good writers can come up with original ideas with existing characters, I enjoy when I am presently surprised with a sequel that I thought I didn\\'t need.What about an anthology or short films that revisit these characters.Bugs Life is due for a sequel.. I want to see how the ant colony is doing now.Sounds forced.I don’t think you can right now...until they add basic features that should have been there at launch it\\'s not possible. the helpline tells you to cancel it and start a new accountThis is not a feature at the moment.

Zendaya is Michelle Jones (MJ) in the movies.   They could do a whole thing where he meets Mary Jane or keep pretending for contractual reasons that Zendaya is sorta MJ.  Either way, One More Day seems a long way off considering he doesn\\'t really have a very solid relationship with \"MJ\".   But I guess it didn\\'t really make much sense in the comics either lol.It\\'s basically the MCU version of Tom King\\'s The Vision with a bit of House of M.

Rated PG-13He will never have a better performance than StaplerDo we know if that extends to live action? It might be limited to animated shows.only for those that are over 44 minutes. under that is Sony\\'sI could see it spinning off into a couple more franchises and the main one ending at 10. ¯\\\\\\\\\\\\_(ツ)_/¯Hopefully there will be a next one... it’s been months since the last BP episode....The Tuba thing is more of a reference to Baman Piderman, but nice other reference, my dude! :)I\\'m almost sure it is limited to animated shows, but it\\'s been too long since I read those documentsI assume it would extend to live action like daredevil and the rest of the Netflix shows.So Disney could make a Spider-Man show if it was 45 minutes long?I’d be okay with spin offs, but I’d love for Fast and Furious to just keep going. If Vin wants to step out let him and bring in new characters or give existing ones bigger/lead roles. I’d be fine if F&F 25 had an entirely different cast, which had been introduced and evolved over time. These movies (in my opinion) have only gotten better with each releaseI know, just felt like throwing that classic in there hahahaso like... a weekly hourlong dramaFive directors confirmed then: -* Jon Favreau* Carl Weathers* Bryce Dallas Howard* James Mangold* Robert RodriguezGood...GoodThat’s really exciting. Looks like Mangold is now on Disney’s radar big time. He’s directing mando episodes and now Indy 5? Hopefully no “creative differences” happenIs there any hope that Taika Waititi will direct again?Takia might be busy making Thor Love and Thunder. These are a good list of Directing. I wonder why Filoni is not directing?Has Carl Weathers ever directed before? Should be interesting.Im hyped for MangoldI\\'m more interested in if their will be more actors showing up in multiple episodes than who is directing them. The show needs a larger more ensemble cast imo, especially since based on how last season ended it seems like Gina and Carl\\'s characters will still be at most reoccurring rather than main characters.Sorry, but I just did not like Bryce\\'s episode in season 1. I hope it was due to writing or something and I end up liking her next one.She directed the most boring episode ugh...[deleted][deleted]I think they are holding out to possibly give him his own Star Wars property.  Just speculation and rumors at this time.I mean, he\\'s probably really busy with Clone Wars, as that series is finishing early summer and there probably wouldn\\'t be time to learn/develop a script while his attention is elsewhere.I take it you have never seen Scandal Makers.I don’t think she wrote it.Hey, shut up. A third of the comments here are you complaining about Bryce. We get it you hate her. Now move alongThe directing in Episode 4 was pretty good. I think you’re confusing the story with directing[deleted]The screenplay for the episode wasn’t  goodI have not. Good?[deleted]People are telling me that it\\'s story board not directing. So my mistake. But I just thought that episode was pretty bland tbhAll of it was mediocre. So boring it was just awful. Ihttps://imgur.com/fERlw48.jpgYou’re right, they’re just another incel on reddit. I actually enjoyed that episode.I agree. There was a supposed time jump that wasn\\'t well established, making the relationship with the native woman feel forced and out of character. Weakest episode of S1.The problem wasn’t the direction, was the screenplayI just didn’t like that they killed Ming Na Wen’s character.  Best part of that episode.Isn\\'t that a different episode?Oh! Yes.  I didn’t realize.  Episode 4 was with the village.  I liked that episode.  Felt very Clint Eastwood western.  Episode 5 was the one that had some problems for me.Only YouTube provides that option. Normal video apps show the maximum available resolution based on device and bandwidth.alrighty! i imagined that would be the case i just didnt want to find out 3 weeks from now that there was a button i missed.If only Marvel  would do DragonCon.I would be interested in knowing what all the films are that have placeholders in Australia. strangely no one has ever mentioned that anywhere and I would be fascinated to see how it compares to the American placeholder list....Is there a quick way to find out, or would I have to go through every title individually?Strangely / sadly no. I just hoped maybe you were privvy to a list. When people were compiling lists like this back in November it frustrated me that nobody ever did one for Canada or Australia or anywhere else...

[https://www.laughingplace.com/w/articles/2019/11/12/76-movies-on-disney-plus-that-arent-actually-on-disney-plus/](https://www.laughingplace.com/w/articles/2019/11/12/76-movies-on-disney-plus-that-arent-actually-on-disney-plus/)This is such bullshit. D+ is gonna piss a lot of people off with this one if they don\\'t just give in and put the more adult version on Hulu. Something tells me Hilary won\\'t come back any other way.If this continues happening with more adult-oriented shows, I\\'m pulling my subscription and will only consider it a month at a time when some of the Star Wars or Marvel shows captivate my interest - so far, beyond The Mandalorian or Imagineering Story, I have been starved for shows that appeal to my tastes or even demographic. To add to that, it\\'s very frustrating that Disney feels as though their library needs to be split between two completely different services, D+ and Hulu. I\\'m finally at the point where I am rooting against Disney Plus and I have Disney tattoos and I obsess over and love Disney. I\\'m tired.They promoted the service with Lizzie McGuire, High Fidelity, and Love Victor and now all 3 are not going to be there. or at least 2 won\\'t. We were misled. Malcolm in the Middle was also advertised as coming to launch. Didn\\'t make it.and this just shows that at this point they are going to continue to be inconsistent (are they ever going to even ACKNOWLEDGE the episodes out of order, let alone fix them, so that their shows can be bingeable?) and completely forget about the adults that are part of the service.We don\\'t all have kids and we don\\'t all want to watch shows sanitized for puritans.They advertised shows that were meant for us and have told us before there WOULD be adult content - maybe not rated R - but adult.It\\'s just infuriating. I truly hope that the services start to fail so that they wake up and instead allow Hulu and Disney Plus to combine and hopefully at that point everything gets really good because I do want them to ultimately succeed but for now I\\'m rooting against it succeeding until they change their philosophy.And that\\'s the only thing that\\'s going to make them do that that. Either that or they need to get a TON of bad press. If the media turns against them then it\\'s possible they will reinstate their shows and even realize that parental controls exist for a reason. They need to stop hiding and policing society!Add all of their incredible TV MA and MA14 content from FX and Fox - AHS and Fargo to Glee to Buffy to New Girl to Family Guy to Bob\\'s Burger\\'s and strengthen the parental controls! Add a passcode when someone on a kid\\'s profile wants to switch to another profile. This would solve the issue of kids seeing content they shouldn\\'t see.I\\'m not just speaking out of my butt - I legitimately have multiple friends that have canceled the service and they actually told me the reason they canceled was because of the fact that they were incredibly surprised and disappointed in how poor the television show lineup was and how Disney Channel oriented it was. This was the reason all of them canceled. Fix it.It’s almost like they should do a Disney plus and Disney plus kids or something or at least make a child account that only has access to the kid stuff and a regular account would just give access to all the things they seem are “adult” but in the grand scheme of things they are probably so tame it’s silly...you can make a kids show with more mature messages. Plenty of cartoons and shows I watched growing up did thatagain, Disney and the fear of leaving the PG-13 ... 😑Wait so can someone tell me what happened I’m this article?Since the launch I give the app a D+everything you just said is exactly my thoughts. how freaking greedy that they think we should now have to have two streaming services just to get their content when if they combine them they would have a service that would rival Netflix and HBO Max which right now completely eclipses them with regards to library and it hasn\\'t even launched.> I have Disney tattoosEwwI really wish that the new president would lead to that going away but I\\'m afraid it\\'s only going to get worseBasically sounds like the original show runner and series creator and Hilary Duff both had a vision of this sequel series to be a bit more adult. When they pitched this for Disney+, Disney execs were fine with it. But after filming two episodes, Disney execs deemed it too adult and not family friendly for D+. Hillary Duff put on her IG story about how Love, Victor was moved from Disney+ to Hulu and Duff commented how that “Sounds familiar” throwing shade at Disney.Not greedy at all honestly. It’s exactly what the vast majority of cord cutters asked for for years. Cost effective choice.I don’t want hulu but I want disney+. I want disney+ cause it has what I want and is cheap enough to justify the cost monthly if I wanted to and then cancel when I feel like it before resuming at another point. Hulu has shows I am beyond not interested in. Like cable, I wouldn’t want to pay for something I’m not interested in.Combining the two raises the price and gives me an hbo max where it’s double the price when all I want are the ghibli films and Cartoon Network.Whereas Disney knows what they’re doing and doing it very well.?what is wrong with the people in this subreddit? downvoting adults for wanting to be represented is just odd gatekeeping. I\\'ve never experienced a subreddit that is so prone to downvoting anyone that speaks slightest ill about the company. It\\'s almost like they don\\'t understand what down votes are actually for...Man where else can they take this show? The teenager is grown up. Shes going to be dealing with adult problems and that can\\'t really be painted in a childish way. Why is disney doing this lolI can understand what you\\'re saying but Hulu in 5 years is going to be a different beast. It is going to almost exclusively just be Disney and Fox content rated R or Ma14.Nope. The different languages are just alternate audio tracks packed around one video; but the video seems geo-locked. There have been several posts about Canadians getting French-Canadian visuals.I think being able to supply alternate videos of titles is the problem is currently tackling with adding the option of 4:3 versions of the Simpsons. So, maybe in the future?I\\'ve been in touch with Disney Plus Support from day 1 about this. The regional video is annoying, but understanding how it currently works, extra storage and a lot of extra work would be needed to provide additional video tracks. They said it would change in the future and they\\'ve already been testing with multiple video tracks for a single movie (for example: \"Frozen\").It\\'s been this way for over three months, and I expect it not to change before the summer.Judging by the very limited content that Disney+ offers in the Netherlands (only 10 classic cartoons, no Rescuers, no TaleSpin, no new library content this week) Disney is clearly focused on the US, Canadian, and Australian markets now. So I wouldn’t expect this issue to be resolved soon.Damn that\\'s annoying, I hope they fix it. It just looks wrong. Thank you thoughI see, thanks!There\\'s no agree verification process that I\\'m aware ofThis is the third time you posted this. You haven\\'t provided any proof of your claim, nor evidence that Disney Plus was wrong in their actions, if true at all.Stop lying.That\\'s what makes it extra weird that they claim my birthday it March 7th, 2003. I was born in 1996. They say it\\'s through \"touchpoints like apps, games, and parks\" that they noticed I \"was under 18.\" The only Disney app I\\'ve used in years is Disney+, and I haven\\'t played their games in at least a decade.How can I prove my claim? I\\'m 23. I\\'ve told them my birthday. My email connected to my account has the same birthday. They claim I\\'m 16. I\\'m the holder of the account.Sorry, my account kept saying \"null\" when I tried to post it.I\\'m not lying. What would I have to gain from lying?It seems that you tried to combine accounts that may or may not have your date-of-birth details. I suggest to create an entirely new account, with a different e-mail address, but correct billing details.It is completely up to you to provide the **correct** details.Do **not** use the option to *\"[ ] Store my payment information for use across the Walt Disney Family of companies.\"*That is, if you are truly 18+.Did ya ever think to send Disney a pic of your driver’s license and you holding up your driver’s license. They’re not just gonna take your word for itI never combined my accounts, though, and I\\'m the only one that\\'s used the Disney+ account.This whole situation with Disney+ is just frustrating. I feel like they\\'re punishing me for an error in their system. I\\'d provide documentation of my birthday if they wanted it, but they never once allowed me to do so.Thanks for your feedback! I truly appreciate it.If they’re going to do so, it would be on D+ as an Incredibles 3 feature film is highly unlikely right now.Pixar as a whole has a ton of potential to expand their feature film franchises - they’ve done a ton with Toy Story already, there will be a Monsters show very soon, and there’s a rumor of a Cars show, so we’ll just have to wait and see what they select. However, Incredibles carries one of the largest potentials for a D+ original show because it has a huge fan base, a ton of supporting characters from the two feature films with a ton of potential, the superhero genre is extremely popular right now, and the possibilities of a storyline that would work would probably come more easily than a show for say, Coco or Inside Out or WALL•E (they’re doable, but I think it’d be a lot harder to get a working plot than the Monsters idea or a car racing or superhero show).If they were going to do something like this I wish they would make it a prequel to The Incredibles and talk about before the Supers were forced into hiding. IMO the costume design and side characters in the flashbacks from the first Incredibles movie were much more interesting than the ones in Incredibles 2. Plus it would give us the opportunity to see more of Elastigirl and Mr. Incredible in their primes.I don\\'t know how I\\'d feel about continuing The Incredibles story on a show, I think the titular family should stay in films. However, an anthology series showing off other heroes and adding depth to the world sounds absolutely phenomenal.read the comics. Especially the latest two arcs. They\\'re how I fully imagine a show like this would be. I LOVED secret identities! It was a fantastic story and one we never really get to see often in superhero showsThiccccWhat are these rumors about a Cars show?Okay there\\'s a couple ways they can get around the whole \"no denand for a third film\" : set it in current-day where the incredible kids are now grown up and that way we get to see other adventures. Another way would be to just tell short stories that are self-contained and explore other characters perhaps characters we have not seen yet.Agree, Anthology would be da bomb. I want to see an origin story for MR. Incredible, Elastigirl, Frozone... maybe how they all met.There\\'s also all the heroes that show up on flashbacks in the first movie... there that pilot guy that Elastigirl knows. The second film set up a bunch of new superheroes so there\\'s that.The only rumor is the last sentence of [this article](https://www.autonews.com/blogs/pixar-motorama-becomes-motoexpo-and-goes-green) but many people accept it to be true.There is demand for the third film.The reason why there won’t be one in the foreseeable future is because Pixar has publicly announced they have no plans to do sequels right now.I\\'m not buying itRight, but is that the right decision... I want to see new stuff in Disney+ I and I\\'m over here waiting for the original shows. I needs more content.By Incredibles 3 not happening, I was referring to a theatrical sequel.As for a D+ original show, Incredibles is probably one of the likeliest candidates from Pixar to receive a show at some point given its potential and popularity, however right now, nothing except for Monsters at Work have been confirmed so only time will tell when/if this will happen. Personally, I both want and hope that there will be an Incredibles show, and I’m sure many people feel the same.Have you tried using your debit card regardless ? In my experience signing up to American sites (gamepass etc) Americans don\\'t seem to hold much distinction between the two, simply using credit card to cover all manner of plastic and PayPal to be an online payment service.Id just go ahead.In the US, retailers generally consider them to be the same thing (at least when offering payment options to consumers). Assuming it’s the same in the UK, it should work in the credit card field.Cheers, I tried my debit card and it was accepted without any problems. Thank you.The Chronicles of Prydain are awesome books, highly recommended to anyone reading this.Hey so fun fact I\\'d heard about Black Cauldron.  Apparently Tim Burton worked on the film, but his designs were thrown out because they were too weird/creepy for the tone of the piece.  He left Disney not long after, but not before sketching the Mayor from Nightmare Before Christmas, which would get him sued years later.If they could have John Byner come back and do another voice, it\\'d be a lot more watchable.Disney should make a live-action miniseries out of the Chronicles of Prydain. Are you reading this, Disney?We just discovered this fact last night! We\\'re scratching our heads wondering how it remains in the shadows at Disney so much... It\\'s a genuinely cool movie with (at the time) cutting-edge visuals and a really thoughtful, stand-out score! (Using the ones throughout kept it from sounding like a cheesy theremin during the creepy climactic moment!) And John Hurt as the Horned King is everything Skeletor wanted to be, so why not merchandise in competition with He-Man figures? It just feels like Eisner and Katzenberg decided it was for nerds and tried to bury it.On the subject of comparing it to LOTR, I do feel like the source material was at least influenced by Tolkien even though it weaves a story from adapted Welsh mythology... In the pentalogy, the Horned King (like Tolkien\\'s Witch King) is merely a warlord for Auron (anything like Sauron?)... On the other hand, it\\'s hard to find post-WWII high fantasy that\\'s not at least a little bit Tolkienesque. I think the similarities to LOTR in the film are **more** apparent probably from Disney hoping to profit on the similarities by painting Gurgi as a Gollum/Smeagol (cowardly, not always trustworthy, calls the hero \"master\", etc.) and Taran\\'s sword as Sting, etc.So late to the party on this post, but having been brought up on \"bargain bin\" VHS, this was an absolute firm favourite in our household. Such amazing moody colours and expressions in the characters and not the typical princess story. We loved it.Its the first new at the time (non re-release) Disney movie I remember seeing in the theater, and it was pretty dark for kids. Not \"Dark Crystal\", \"Secret of Nimh\", or \"Return to Oz\" dark, but dark for a Disney film. At some point I should watch it as an adult - I\\'ve just never had a desire to.Curious, how did sketching the Mayor from Nightmare Before Christmas before leaving Disney get him sued, when that movie was released later by Disney/Touchstone anyway?That would be awesome.I was just telling my husband about a similar idea! Disney\\'s on a live-action remake kick (especially being unafraid of amping up edginess and fear factor), so how awesome would a live-action remake be?? The Horned King would be astounding!!(They\\'ve been big in amping up feminism in the remakes, so imagine Taran not just being a \"girls are icky only because I haven\\'t fallen in love yet\" boy, but genuinely just a misogynist because the only female in his whole upbringing was literally the pig. Then Eilonwy proves him wrong with her heroism, and Taran\\'s low point in his hero\\'s journey where he\\'s all \"I am just a pig boy\" is partly his struggle reconciling what he once believed about women with Eilonwy\\'s badassery, and then turns around to finish the story *with* Eilonwy and they wrap the story up as equals. It can work!!)It is dark, but, like, consider that in Oliver & Co., two dogs die of electrocution on the NYC subway tracks, and a guy in his car gets run over by a train. But it\\'s ok, because they\\'re baddies! /s At least The Black Cauldron establishes and maintains a certain creepy, fantastical tension even if it is momentarily broken by sunshine in the woods and going among the fair-folk... There\\'s at least always the aesthetic of fantasy--it\\'s not real! It can\\'t happen! Oliver & Co. just jerks you around in modernized Dickens realism; it opens with an innocent kitten not getting adopted and becoming a stray, moves to Dodger being slick and upbeat as a stray dog and Georgette being hilarious Bette Midler as a pempered pooch, climaxes with child kidnapping and 3 deaths on the train tracks, and ends with a literal birthday party--all set in real-life NYC with realistic conflicts like money lending and gang violence. Talk about an emotional rollercoaster!Wow.  You\\'ve led me to my own personal mandela effect.  I\\'ll update you if I turn out not to be crazy.(EDIT) Whether I\\'m crazy or not remains to be seen, but here\\'s my memory:&#x200B;Nightmare Before Christmas wasn\\'t distributed by Disney (or Buena Vista, Touchstone, etc.).  Circa 2000, they sued Tim Burton because the movie featured a character which Disney owned the rights to, specifically the Mayor he\\'d sketched while working for them in the 80\\'s.  At the end of the lawsuit, they owned all rights to the movie, but offered Burton a very lucrative five picture deal.&#x200B;This might be made up, but I clearly remember it being true.  That he worked on Black Cauldron isn\\'t up for debate though:  [https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/The\\\\_Black\\\\_Cauldron?file=Burton-kahl.jpg](https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/The_Black_Cauldron?file=Burton-kahl.jpg).  His character designs are pretty far from what they used in the end.Thanks, and for the record, I remember something similar. I just couldn\\'t make sense of Disney being the ones suing, since it was their own movie, but maybe Nightmare wasn\\'t originally? This explanation seems plausible enough. This was at a time when internet gossip was still limited, or else everyone would have been up in arms about this whole thing, and we would probably have a better record of it. In all honestly there only thing that wasn\\'t familiar about this was the fact that Burton had artwork for The Black Cauldron, as I couldn\\'t remember which movie it was that was claimed to have taken prior IP from.That stuff is pretty darn cool, and resembles a lot of his early work, including Beetlejuice. It would be cool to get a \"What if\" reincarnation from Disney and Burton on Disney+ or something.Some?More specific information might result in a solution.Same thing has been happening to me for a week or so. We\\'ve been able to cast to both of our Chromecast Ultras pretty much since launch. All of a sudden, most titles we try to cast just sit there buffering for several minutes and then time out. It\\'s not all content, but it\\'s a vast majority (probably 90%+ of the ones we\\'ve tried).The videos play fine on our phones (iPhone XS and iPhone 11 Pro Max), but then they buffer when we cast them. We have Verizon Fios Gigabit internet. Speeds are fine, anywhere between 500-900mbps down. Tried it with the Chromecast wired directly to the router, as well as wireless. Also tried it from a laptop with Chrome, same behavior (fine on laptop, won\\'t play on Chromecast).Factory reset both Chromecasts, reinstalled the Disney+ app on both phones. No dice. Every other streaming app we have (Hulu, Netflix, Youtube TV, Youtube) works perfectly and displays in 4k if the content is 4k, so it doesn\\'t seem to be an issue with the hadware or with our network, but with Disney+ specifically. Checked the firmware version of both Chromecasts as well as the version of the app to make sure everything was up to date (it was).It\\'s a little frustrating, as we got Disney+ specifically for the content that our daughter loves, but it just won\\'t work. I chatted with Disney+ support and the person escalated it to their tech team. It\\'s \"high\" priority, which has a 5-10 day expected response time. I\\'d hate to hear how long it would take to get a response to a lower priority ticket.For example, Alice in Wonderland will play on the Chromecast Ultra but none of the Marvel movies will. The app works fine with a standard Chromecast but has issues casting to Chromecast Ultra.Is the device using a wired or wireless connection, and have you checked firewall settings in your router? The necessary bandwidth may be too much for the connection, or perhaps even what your provider allows for streaming.My guess is Disney+ has some bugs with their content filtering on Kids labeled profiles. I see it’s rated TV-G and shouldn’t be filtered but it is on my children’s profiles as well.Interestingly, Finding Nemo is available on my kid’s profile as it’s rated G, but Finding Dory is not since it’s PG. It’s a screwy system that needs more granular controls.I’ve been wondering about this as well. Assuming it’s just a glitch in the new system. Cars 3 isn’t available in my kids profile but I can find it on mine.They appear to be having issues or maybe some crazies are complaining. I started a thread on the same thing happening with Fancy Nancy. Same situation doesn\\'t appear in Kids Profile but does in the adult profile. This to be an on going greater issue.One Bob to another Bob.New Episodes of The Imagineering Story coming soon.Wasn’t this always the plan?Disney+ was supposed to be his walk-off, his legacy... mission accomplished, so peace!He’s spent his entire career learning under fire, walking before running. He clearly thinks Chapek has what it takes. Excited to see what Iger does from a pure creative position. Chapek has the operation chops to captain the ship day-to-day.He’s really set up Disney for success, Disney+ and the Acquisition of Fox. As he says, it’s a good time. Another smart move is to make it really a year long transition where the new CEO reports to him. It’s not dissimilar to Steve Jobs taking on the role of chairman of the board at Apple while giving the reins to Tim Cook making the transition more smooth.I... am... Bob Iger.\\\\*snap\\\\*Wow, this subreddit is A LOT more level headed than the Disney Parks subreddit. You would think Bob Chapek announced that his first act as CEO was going to be to shut down the company.Iger did tremendous things to grow the company and expand the creative portfolio; it seems that Chapek has a lot of the same approaches to follow the same path.With something like this though, only time will truly tell.Interesting. I\\'m excited to see the transition but hope all the changes are seamless and good. And selfishly dont effect disney+.Wow. Where the hell did that come from? Health reasons maybe? I really admired him after watching the imagineering documentary.Dude had an amazing run. Disney has become more profitable than ever under him, and he should be a incredibly proud of himself. Sad to see him go, he’s done some truly great things for fans and for people.Someone protect Spider-Man!!!Aww man that sucks. He is a big inspiration of mineSo Bob got Bob’s jobEnd of an era.Step right up  Reggie Fils-AiméI hope his successor is as kind to the imagineers as He was.End of an eraHe said in his book he wanted to retired a long ago but wanted to complete Disney ShanghaiHe looks like the professor from Big Hero 6Thanks for Disney+ Bob.Chapek taking over is utterly horrifying.He did an amazing job with Disney.  Hopefully his successor is just as good as he was.Name nepotismHopefully he takes Kathleen Kennedy with him.Thanks for the good times, Bob. Awesome work :)To facilitate this Bob to Bob knowledge transfer, Bob #1 is elevating to a creative role until 2021.Iger should be looked upon as an icon for what he has done for Disney since he replaced Eisner. When he came in Steve Jobs was adamant Pixar was done making movies for Disney once the contract ended. In house they were making uninspired and unprofitable animation. The direction Iger took Disney and the relationships he salvaged cannot be understated. I Read his book which was great. I don’t think anyone else could have swooped in and acquired Marvel at the point he did. The owner of Marvel at the time was kind of a reclusive figure who had to be handled with kid gloves. The conspiracy theorist and cynic in me says that Iger left over the feeling of felling guilty of helping end the Fox movie empire as we knew it by buying it from Rupert Murdoch.Thank you Bob for letting Kevin Feige do his thing.Tom Staggs should\\'ve gotten this job. He did everything Chapek did and was the CFO of the company and had his fingerprints all over the Pixar and LucasFilm acquisitions, not to mention extensive experience in running the media units and was well liked by fans and employees. He would visit the parks and take pictures with visitors who recognized him. I felt like after Disney lost Staggs, they realized it was a mistake which shows because they were unable to identify anyone else who was even remotely second best and decided to \"settle\" with Chapek before time runs out.He will be the 2024 Steyer spending millions of his own money trying to become the President. Another corporate leftist who made millions while in the  executive suite.Can we have song of the south nowHe has already destroyed Star Wars so it\\'s too little too late.Not now, Lumbergh, I gotta meeting with the Bobs.What would you say you do around here?We fixed the glitchyes pleaseMaking major company decisions to add more content to your streaming service is tight!Season 2 is episodes are already planned and partially done and wouldn\\'t make sense to involve something happening in 2020.First thing I thought as well, wouldn\\'t that just be a shame. /sYes, he has actually already delayed his planned retirement for several years. He is also staying on as Executive Chairman until the end of 2021.People read headlines and freak out.It’s not for Disney+ particularly. More so to oversee the acquisition, and subsequent transition, of all the 20th Century Fox assets.Now of course, with Disney having a whole fleet of new IPs (Marvel, SW and Fox stuff); it’s literally the perfect time to have the former head of Parks and Services take over as CEO.Galaxy’s Edge, the Marvel Avengers Campus and Pandora. What major branch is next I wonder?Don’t forget under his leadership he bought marvel and Star WarsMuch more than a year, actually - 22 months (almost 2 years). I agree - that’s starting Chapek out on a successful path by having such a long transition.\"Iger Man?\"Well, a lot of stuff that makes the Parks really magical doesn’t necessarily translate directly to profit from an accountant’s perspective. Realism and immersion, for example. So I’m actually not surprised people are worried, especially when the parks are already quite expensive and he’s known to be more profit focused.Do you think D+ could get more content due to it and be better for him stepping down?He was set to retire next year anywayThis has been planned for a while. He was supposed to step down a few years ago but wanted to oversee the Fox acquisition and cement his legacy.Well I mean not to be that guy but if you’re doing a documentary on the boss you’ll probably give him the hero edit. That said things at Disney are better than everHe was going to retire a few years ago but decided to stick it out until Disney+ launched to ensure its successMission accomplished, so it\\'s time to retireHealth reasons?! What??Naw dawg, he was always slated to step down. They just extended his stay in order for him to oversee the acquisition of the Fox properties.This was well publicized last year fwiw[deleted]Couldn\\'t agree more.He did an amazing job and I\\'m sad to see him go.*errorWhy?And I\\'m generally curious, don\\'t know much about him.Was thinking this exactly.Yes!It had to have been discussed with Murdock that Disney was planning on using 20th Century Fox for the IP and was planning on essentially shutting down studio production. I don’t think Iger would be feeling guilty of something that was planned from the start.I thought anti-leftists loved financial success (or the illusion of financial success via no tax returns). You\\'re republiking wrong. Obey El Cheeto.Yeaaa....YOU SLEPT WITH LUMBERGH? LUMBERGH?!?!I see someone is a man of culture as well!Is this posted anywhere?You’re literally making this up. There’s no source for this claim.Source?I took that last sentence as a command rather than a statement.  Business as usual.And Pixar.  First thing he did.*three finger Mickey Mouse glove snap*I completely understand concern. I’m just optimistic as we are on the heels of Star Wars land which is probably the most immersive and realistic land they have ever done. Rise of the Resistance is simply incomparable to other theme park attractions.The CEO being changed has nothing to do with content being released on D+I know. But that’s next year, not now. And not so suddenly.It has nothing to do with Star Wars.Disney\\'s capitalization went from under $50 billion when Iger took over to over $250 billion today. It has nothing to do with money lol.Star Wars is a drop in the bucket for Disney. All of their movies are. Pretty sure at least 50% of their revenue alone comes TV networks ESPN and ABC plus their Parks division. Merchandise also makes more than all their movies combined. Disney only makes content to have new stuff to sell.5 movies combined net them 5.75 billion dollars. If that\\'s what poorly done means, what exactly is your metric for success?How could they have done so poor if all but one over preformed?The movies have made over five billion dollars, and the TV shows and merchandise is printing money for them. You can bash Star Wars all you want because it’s the easy trendy thing to do, but this is clearly not his fault that people don’t like the story. He bought the properties, that’s it. He didn’t write, direct, cast, or produce.Not even remotely.Maybe. But everything else has done amazing- the parks, Disney +, the mandelorian, marvel.From what I understand, he\\'s been known as a \"profit over customer experience\" type. Guess we\\'ll see how this goes.No, the real plan, to me, was to end a storied legacy of film history (Fox Films) so Disney could get a semi-monopoly at the box office. Murdoch and Iger were willing to and intended on getting as many lay-offs as necessary to do so. The importance of having more movie IPs to compete with Netflix was just an excuse.Super easy, barely an inconvenience.I couldn\\'t find anything about it by doing a Google search.It\\'s not my problem that you don\\'t know how to use Google to find answers to questions that have been answered.DisneyIger was the President of ABC when Disney bought it in the 90s. So he saw first hand how successful buyouts like that could be.It was Iger stepping in after Michael Eisner that made the Pixar deal possible.  IIRC, Steve Jobs and Eisner absolutely despised each other, and once Eisner was out of the way, that was what really paved the way for the acquisition.And OswaldThat’s true, but Chapek was the one responsible for a lot of cuts. There were supposed to be walk around characters and free-roaming droids. There was originally going to be a third attraction where you could be pulled by a Bantha from one end of the land to the other. There was going to be a table-service restaurant/dinner club. There was going to be live entertainment/stunt shows on the roofs. All of this was cut by Chapek.Ok thanksHe’s staying on as Executive chairman until he retires so it feels like its a transitory move so he can oversee his successorThe stock markets have dropped dramatically the last two days over coronavirus fears. CEO compensation is tied to stock price performance among other financial metrics. Maybe he figured it wasn’t worth it given the market conditions and Star Wars flopThe last year has had a lot of CEO departures https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ceo-departures-economy-120003068.htmlHe\\'s overseeing the transition for a year so makes sense. Like the new CEO has to report directly to him for a year.It has to be the Star Wars they wanted. Sometimes people just look to hate.I\\'m gonna need you to get ALL the way off my back!Same. I think it’s be big news in this community.The limited series grew out of a feature length documentary that was being developed in the same style as The Pixar Story. It wasn’t developed to be a series with seasons.With how long production on these episodes took, I don’t expect them to expand the series any time soon.No. It’s not on Google. It’s not anywhere. Because you’re literally making it up on the spot.Stop lying.Is there a link to Disney stating this at all?Yeah he got Hulu completely under Disney as well.Why did Steve Jobs hate Eisner? I was always under the impression that Eisner was a good guy...Yeah, I read somewhere he was also responsible for the excessive marketing of frozen, lolYes. It says that in the article. But stepping down as CEO immediately- just wow.He confirmed on CNBC that the timing is terrible, but it has nothing to do with the markets.What Star Wars flop? A billion dollar film is in no way a \"flop\".It’s not typical for a CEO to resign because of market conditions in a very short period time. Give it a few months and the markets will begin to bounce back.Plus, he led Disney to make a profit through the Great Recession. The current market state is nothing compared to that.There\\'s no way he decided this in the past 2 days.Last Jedi and Rise of Skywalker were trash content wise. But financially they did very well. So I don’t that that was it.Okay let me get off that thing[removed]www.google.comI thought Disney just has a controlling stake now but not complete ownership. Doesn\\'t NBC still have some ownership?Part of it was their personalities.  Another was that Eisner tried to screw Pixar based on the terms of their original deal.  IIRC, Eisner wanted to do sequels and not count them towards the number of movies as part of the deal.If you\\'ve read at least the opening chapter of his book, you get why he\\'d probably jump at the chance to let someone else take over. It sounds like one of the most stressful jobs on the planet besides being a (legitimate) politician.Uh, from a stock perspective it is. Stocks are priced based on growth and the movie brought in one billion less than The Force Awakens.Wowowowowow!You don’t understand how Google works if you think you need to search the entirety of the internet in order to find if something even exists.Again, you are literally making this up. You have no source. If you had one, you would have posted it by now. You’re just full of it. That’s all.What a d bagComcast/NBC still owns a ⅓ of Hulu, but they’ve given Disney 100% control with an option to sell their ⅓ to Disney at fair market value as early as 2024.would you recommend his book? I enjoy successful people\\'s memoirs, not sure if this one is more disney backstage gossip or if Iger has insightful lessons worth learning. tbh, i know very little on his background beyond being head of ABC and then DisneyTbf I didn’t know there was a new Star Wars movie out... I’m not exactly a shut in, but I am typically harder to reach. (I don’t have cable) so I didn’t hear about it? Once I saw friends talking about going to see it, I just said oh... and never saw as much as a trailer online. So, mild fans (like me) who just said “meh I’ll see it eventually “  and have a bit of Star Wars exhaustion  likely caused the flopNahHe spends a good bit in the first half talking about his early days at ABC pre-Disney buyout.Yes. We all know you’re full of it. Put up or shut up.No, unfortunatelyThey haven\\'t put nearly enough OT and PT characters in yet. No Han (5 movies) but we have BB-8 (3 movies)?\\'Tis demanded by the gods; it is!How wude!Try itYet the Simpsons, a show with their fair share of violent and crude moments, as well as The X-Men movies are fine? Btw the X-Men movies have f bombs in them, and they\\'re uncensored on Disney + which is bizarre... They really need other PG13 content not just G/PG teeny content. I\\'m sorry but this song no Netflix killer... Not even closeIts strange because when you create an user account in D+ if you mark them as a child account they can\\'t access the PG-13 content - even some PG content is hidden (my daughter\\'s account couldn\\'t watch \"The Santa Clause\" for example).Don\\'t see why they couldn\\'t just put all the non-R rated content on D+ and let the built in user settings filter it out.I don’t think Disney understands their audience. Lizzie McGuire aired from 2001-2004. The fans of the original show are now adults. Doesn’t it makes sense for the show to be geared for adults?? It is so dumb to try to keep Disney+ “family friendly”I genuinely hope Disney is taking note of everyone\\'s criticism towards Love, Victor being moved. They absolutely deserve to be called out for the hypocrisy.It seems they\\'ve ridiculously decided on a Disney Channel level of prudishness for original content. The HSM series also got retooled to remove more \"mature\" themes. There\\'s no way the Lizzie show was terribly adult-themed, but I expect even a mild allusion to sex got red flagged.This makes me so mad, and there\\'s nothing I can do about it.The original pitch for the Lizzie McGuire revival was a show about a woman managing life in her 30\\'s. It was supposed to be targeted for fans of the original that are now adults.Instead we are going to get another Disney Channel show aimed at kids who never even saw the original version, that exploits its \\'classic\\' IP to trick the parents into watching too.Look, I like Disney Channel shows. I liked a lot of stuff aimed at kids. But for once I was hoping a show I watched as a kid was actually going to grow up with me.This is Girl Meets World and Raven\\'s Home all over again.I wonder where the Lizzie reboot would end up in Canada, since we don’t have Hulu (honestly I think it would end up on D+ here). I actually think it would be cool to have a show that grew up with its audience and explores more mature themes— I don’t really think today’s kids (Disney+’s target audience) are into Lizzie like that to be wanting a spin-off anyway. As long as we actually *get it* and they make a real effort with it, I don’t care where it airs. I just want it to air period and reflect the creator’s vision (still mad she got booted. The last series she walked away from immediately shot itself in the foot and never recovered).Yeah D+ has Avatar and theres a bunch of naked blue alien in itFunny how they won’t put lgbtq content but they’ll put kids getting killed by anakin skywalker and thanos getting his head decapitatedI can\\'t even fathom how \\'Lizzie Mcguire\" would have been written inappropriately. Lizzie got into BDSM as she got older? Gordo\\'s an addict? Matt is a criminal? There\\'s a much higher chance the powers that be just didn\\'t think the scripts were any good.Anakin penetrates toddlersI would argue that The Simpson’s doesn’t belong in Disney+. Should be on Hulu instead.Wait. They keep The f-bomb in X-Men, but remove it from Adventures in Babysitting? Criminal.They definitely are. They hate bad pressThis is DuckTales vs Legend of the Three Caballeros as well.DuckTales 2017 is great, but it is primarily a show about *kids*: about Huey, Dewey, and *especially* Louie first—not even as their traditional selves but as effectively new characters, talking and acting more like insecure fratboys. Scrooge, and other adult characters I think most viewers (even, importantly, children) come to the series to watch, are played as secondary to these kids, and far less often viewpoint characters.The marketing is slanted this way too: viewers are expected to tune in and live vicariously through the nephews. Everything else is secondary.By contrast, Legend of the Three Caballeros accepts its childish adult leads as viewpoint characters for everybody—and Disney suits quite clearly didn\\'t expect that approach to succeed, backbenching the show until leaks and overwhelming praise forced them to release it.\"Disney is just for kids\" is a popular superstition that Disney has, quite damagingly, taken to heart.Does that mean they won’t include Onward since they’re promoting a Lesbian cop in the movie? LolOr, you know, it\\'s a show about a now 30 year old something woman navigating her life. Adult themes would seem necessary to me.no thats miranda thats an addictThey refuse to put Family Guy or American Dad on there so it doesn\\'t make sense why The Simpsons is OK.I can see eventually, when everything on Hulu is Disney owned or acquired content that it all goes to Disney Plus with accounts levels that unlock certain rated content. It\\'ll be the same price as the \"bundle\" is now. It\\'s too confusing on where to find everything right now..I know makes no senseto get subscribersDoes anyone know anything about this issue?More original, mature content that\\'s like PG-13. After the news of the Lizzie McGuire show being halted for being \"too adult\" and Love, Victor being moved to Hulu, I\\'m afraid that Disney+ is going to be super stale in comparison to Netflix. No show creator is going to want to work with Disney if they keep being so inconsistent in policing their ideas.A bunch of the The Wonderful World of Disney made for TV movies. Mostly from the 80s. Some were unused pilots and never released to DVD.Aladdin the series, Dinosaurs, House of Mouse.Tron Uprising season 2!All of the old 60s movies. Also make mine music.Aladdin The Animated Series, The Legend of Tarzan, House of Mouse, Buzz Lightyear of Star Commanddog with a blogPepper Ann.Netflix\\'s marvel seriesThe Weekenders. That is allThe 3D versions of their films.Ludwig von Drake and his lovable sidekick Herman!Cheaper by the Dozen 2I want what they should have done in prep for launch. All the episodes of all the Mickey mouse club iterations possible. They should have launched with a bunch more and had a  roadmap type thing announced where every month a few weeks worth would drop. It could have been a ongoing thing for multiple years. It would have been fascinating and so much excitement every month knowing that another week or so of Mickey mouse club episodes would drop...More bingeable content like• Last Man Standing• Fresh Off The Boat• Modern Family• Futurama• Bobs Burgers• King of the Hill• Black-ish• America’s Funniest Home Videos• Home ImprovementEtcThis is what I came here to say. Disney+ is also complying with typical American double standards by being comfortable with all the violence in The Mandalorian but not \"mature themes\".You are easily pleased! That should be there by the end of the year.Yeah give us Mandolarion levels of PG-13.exactly. I\\'m freaking exhausted with this ongoing disgusting American concept that violence is okay but sex and drugs are not. what on earth...Have you tried putting the router in riceBTW I’m KiddingIm Hawking the same issue here. Nothing loading and get a error Message*havingDoes pre-ordering (still) exist?Yes until march 23rd.Yes but that is not the thing I want to talking about.Okay. I thought, maybe it\\'s a mistake. It could be that you need a verifiable payment method (bank account or credit card) because D+ is not available in your country yet.Do you live in Germany and try to pre order with PayPal?Honestly it’s not having the original content.  We’re at a stand still waiting on things like the marvel mini series,  etc to come out.  It was nice during Christmas for the holiday movies but I don’t find myself watching it right now because other services currently have more options for viewing.D+ is still a young service, and almost all the non-\"Originals\" content was already previously available elsewhere to stream or buy/rent digitally. The files existed and Disney just pulled them all in one place (with very little care for curation). * Disney can still dig deep into the vault for additional material that hasn\\'t been made available digitally* Disney will be releasing a lot more original content* Syndication/streaming rights to newer TV shows will eventually revert back* The 20th Century/HBO studio output deal will eventually end* Disney has a lot of technical issues to fix - security, front-end, back-end, etc.I think most of the posts here show the service was not quite ready to launch and Disney didn\\'t allot enough resources for getting content set and making sure the UI/UX and delivery were smooth. There were also some (unreasonable) expectations that films would be on Disney+ as soon as they released in the theater or TV episodes would instant come to D+ after airing, etc. It took Netflix, 10 years to get where they are in the streaming world.I feel Disney Plus needs more bingeable content on their service. The Simpsons is a great example of bingeable content. But they should add more shows like Fresh Off The Boat, Modern Family, Black-ish, Bob’s Burgers, etc.Where is my Muppets show Disney?The weakest thing right now (in my humble opinion) is the age of content. They try to market this service to many adults riding of three things: Star Wars, Simpsons, and MCU. None one of these three are being updated regularly. There is other good adult content (Jeff Goldblum, etc.); however, it is nowhere near strong enough to stand on its own. Disney needs to figure out where the appropriateness and some maturer content meet. In my opinion, it needs to just meet the Simpsons test; is it less appropriate? Bob\\'s Burgers, a now-Disney piece of content, I believe meets these requirements.For me, it\\'s the lack of original content that feels like \"Disney\". The Mandalorian is very good and I really liked \"Forky asks a question\" (although you could marathon it in under an hour). but a lot of the other original content just feels like the kind of stuff we see in the modern Disney channel (just trying to be trendy and doing the same with so much live action).I find it odd that almost none of the original content is animation. That\\'s really what defined the old Disney channel for me (Buzz Lightyear star command, Brandy and mr whiskers, Dave Barbarian, Kim possible, American Dragon, Aladdin TV show, Timon & pumpaa, House of mouse, etc).And why not more classic content outside Pixar? why not make a new house of mouse, or reboot kim possible, or a new darkwing duck.It\\'s expected given the lapse in new content.  By Fall D+ will have new eps of highly anticipated shows almost every week. Falcon > Mando S2 > Wandavision > Loki > What if?  D+ will be trending way up at that time.Note that the article is about the number of Google searches for Disney+ compared to Netflix, which isn’t saying a lot about actual usage of the service. It’s not indicative of any problems for Disney+.Also, I don’t think that Disney’s goal for Disney+ is to be a ‘Netflix killer’ or something like that. This is a long-term project (they don’t expect it to be profitable for the first 5 years) with the objective to change the way they make money off their library. Instead of licensing their movies to parties like Netflix, they cut out the middleman and stream them by themselves. As long as they make enough money doing this, they don’t have to be bigger than Netflix.Personally, I have no problem waiting a bit longer for new original content. It will be there eventually. My big issue with Disney+ is the fact that we in the Netherlands miss out on so much classic library content that is readily available in other markets. Classics like the Rescuers, Mickey’s Christmas Carol, and Talespin are missing. We only got 10 classic animated shorts. Also no sign of shows like Bonkers, Doug, Hercules, Teacher’s Pet, and Emperor’s New School. Lately I am reading a lot of complaints here about the delay of the Lizzie McGuire reboot; we don’t even have the original series to watch! An old movie like My Dog, The Thief was recently made available in all markets, except the Netherlands. Earlier this week the original Pete’s Dragon movie was suddenly removed. Things like this are increasing the list of missing content on a weekly basis.The customer service here has no clue about the reasons; apparently these decisions are made in Burbank and they are not told about them. None of the missing content is being broadcast on another channel here, so it can’t be a licensing issue. I am totally fine with having to wait for content, but it would be great if Disney could give a clue about whether we will ever see this content at all.The metric isn\\'t the best for measuring success; but it wouldn\\'t at all surprise me if it\\'s on the decline. There\\'s tons of content missing that should\\'ve been there day 1, and the new stuff is generally geared towards babies.The bulk of the bingeable stuff is animated. That\\'s just fine for me. Takes me back. I didn\\'t get it for new stuff anyway. I just got it for Disney stuff I wanted to watch without having to buy crappy DVDs or stream through Russia. I\\'ll eventually get to Jeff GoldblumThis is my thought exactlyAtleast give us the Disney channel series we all want....I\\'m sure all those UK watchers have waited impatiently until now to see what the show is all about.I personally think doing weekly releases for episodes is better than dumping all of them like the Netflix binge-watching model. However, it is ridiculous to do it if the show is already fully available in other regions.Well that sucksWow. Making the English dub must be rough.The Clone Wars, I get, but making us wait another month just to catch up to the dead hype of The Mandalorian is far too much.TCW will be halfway done by then as wellLook at how displeased baby yoda looks in the thumbnailAbsolutely ridiculous that they\\'re still going to be released weekly. It\\'s already done! Just release them all!Well thank goodness for that. I totally haven\\'t watched it already.That\\'s a bit annoying, I think we\\'ve waited long enough. Obvious ploy to keep people subscribed with minimal content.I guarantee you anyone from the UK who wanted to watch the show has definitely already watched it one way or another.Since they want you to disable adblock, here\\'s the answer: \"Disney Plus is finally making its way to the UK only a few short months after The Mandalorian has been completely and utterly spoiled for everyone over there thanks to an infinite amount of Baby Yoda memes.Disney has announced the release date for The Mandalorian in the UK, which will be Tuesday, March 24, also the release date of the Disney Plus app generally. And to answer your second question, no, Disney is not dropping all the episodes at once even though we Americans have already seen them, they are still going to be releasing the eight episodes over a period of eight weeks, it seems.\"Why? Makes no sense Disney. If you keep doing greedy things like this....Did this nonsense happen when Disney+ launched 2 weeks after the US in some territories? Were there three episodes from the get go or were they permanently three episodes behind?I wonder how will that work when they release it on markets when the second season of stuff is already being released. Dump the first at once and weekly releases for the second? Weekly release the whole thing? Weekly release of the first, then wait 6 months and only then weekly release of the second?If it has the entire Clone Wars, 90s Spider-Man TAS (and maybe even Spectacular Spider-Man) and 90s X-Men I\\'ll sub even if I\\'ve already seen MandoThis whole week to week thing is so tedious. If I want to sit on the couch and spend my weekend watching an entire series in one hit, I should be able to dammit.What \\\\*I\\\\* want to know is what OTHER shows are doing the unnecessary weekly roll out and which are actually being PROPERLY dumped in full (as in, because they already \"aired.\")I had no idea it wasn\\'t already available worldwide.  Why would they do this, especially with a show available only by streaming over the Internet?  Disney made the show, Disney made the distribution platform, why delay the release in certain countries?I don\\'t understand Disney\\'s insistence on weekly releases.I\\'ve had to \\'travel\\' to watch Mando and The Imagineering Story.Cant see myself subscribing until something of interest pops up or unless the massively expand their offerings like a library style archiveWaiting till May by the looks of it for me then.well thats a mistake[removed][removed][removed][removed]> And yet it’s pretty easy to imagine why Disney is doing this, and it’s one of the core reasons they did this in the US release as well. Unlike Netflix, which has roughly **eleven million original shows** to hook people each year, Disney Plus is starting out with much less programmingWho the heck wrote this article? 11 million?  There aren’t even 1 million movies or shows in Netflix’s total libraries across all different regions, let alone 11 million “Netflix original” shows. This is irresponsible journalism by Forbes because it seems to make the price for Netflix more justified than Disney’s quote-unquote “paltry” offering of 8 originals.ETA:Tweeted the guy who wrote this article and his response was [“it’s a joke”](https://twitter.com/paultassi/status/1232338903010545671?s=21) lol.Bad call. Considering its been out since November in North America, just release it all at once for UK folks to binge. I mean... unless everyone has been totally respectful and not seen spoilers/watched the show by other means... right?That\\'s so ridiculous to release episodes weekly when the whole season has already launched and aired in other countries with spoilers and entire weekly breakdowns of those episodes available all over the internet.I’m in the U.S. and I still haven’t watched the show, but my goodness Baby Yoda is so cute!I cant believe it hasnt been released in the UK yetThis is the way.Weekly episodes? All the episodes are currently available in HD at various places online already.It was cornball tv straight from the 50’s/60’s set on top of a star wars backdrop... they aren’t missing anythingThis is the wayAbsolutely, we have not been watching it through other means. Not at all. I relish this weekly release schedule. Yes.I’ve been waiting impatiently. I’m annoyed at the wait, I’m annoyed at the weekly release schedule but I still think it’s going to be worth it.I actually have though, because it\\'s such an effort to find a different way to watch it that would actually work.exactly. on both accounts .Something like arrested development back in the day? Totally would have benefited from a full season release. Week to week is only ever argued through the already thin as ice argument that it makes people feel better about having something to look forward to. It’s never about what the format does for the actual showNetflix has been doing weekly releases for more and more of their original series (The Good Place f.e.).I totally agree on your second point though.Apple does weekly releases of their dramas too, and I love the slow and steady drip feed. It lets me sit on each episode and think about it more. And it builds my anticipation for Fridays.I think it depends on the show. Something like Sex Education that has a specific niche might be good for dumping an entire season at once. On the other hand, The Witcher definitely would’ve benefited from a weekly release schedule. Netflix could have milked that so much more.Just don\\'t watch them all at once.I agree for shows that are amazing. For the shitty Mandalorian I disagree. Imagine waiting weeks for such a let down. Massive Disney budget with shitty Crackle TV execution.That’s a very sadist attitude about release schedules.Oh just add some \"pip pips\" and \"cheerios\" and call it done.It was already done when they released it at first as well.And *I* can guarantee *you* that not everyone will have done that. *Citation: me*It’s not that greedy. Yes they are making it weekly which is stupid, but it’s a business tactic so people won’t just use their free weekly subscription then leaveWhen the service launched two weeks later in NZ and Australia the existing episodes were just there.The series hadn\\'t started thenThe new season being a weekly makes sense. The already released and everyone already knows season being weekly released is genuinely naive on Disney’s part.Disney+ hasn\\'t launched at all in those countries yet. The first episode of the Mandalorian will be available on the same day Disney+ is in the UK.There was no point launching the service earlier as they had to wait for other deals to expire of the service would have been almost empty.they\\'re also in 4k if you know where to look ;)Yes, I have also been patiently waiting for this official release, and have no idea that this will become one of my favourite Star Wars shows.Disney $$$It helps with the \"social\" aspect of the show. As someone who does not have time to binge watch an entire season in a week I\\'m never able to participate in any online discussion if a season is released all at once. With The Mandalorian I was able to keep up and not need to worry about avoiding spoilers all the time.By the time I finish a season of an all-at-once release everyone has moved on to talking about something else.The only time Netflix (to my knowledge) has done weekly releases is when they\\'re not true originals. The Good Place, for example, is an NBC show in the US (and had weekly releases as is standard for broadcast TV) - Netflix just had the rights to it in the rest of the world (or most of the rest of the world).The good place is not a Netflix showI think the \"Netflix Originals\" that have weekly releases are actually network shows that Netflix have the distribution rights in your region. For instance, The Good Place is an NBC series, and isn\\'t made by Netflix, they just have the distribution rights outside the US.What Good Place season did Netflix (USA) do weekly releases for?  IIRC Netflix has seasons 1-3, all available.  Hulu on the other hand I think is adding season 4 episodes as they air on regular TV.  Are you thinking about Hulu?Agree 100%That\\'s a hell of a lot of confidence you have in the will power of others.  LolBecause your personal taste should dictate a release schedule?Yeah but we didn\\'t know anything, now we do all the discussions have took place there\\'s spoilersBut if the entire show is already available in other regions, then weekly release is ridiculous.I still would\\'ve just waited for them to release all episodes then watch it all at once.[removed]Surely it had? It started on day 1 in the US and then two weeks later the service launched in Australia.Yo ho yo ho.... something something life for me>By the time I finish a season of an all-at-once release everyone has moved on to talking about something else. Me with The Witcher. It\\'s especially bad with shows that I cant watch until after my kid has gone to bed. I\\'m *lucky* if my wife and I can get an episode a week in. Usually by the time our kid has gone to bed, we\\'re winding down for bedtime ourselves.They\\'ve done it with other weekly topic shows, like the Patriot Act and Chelsea\\'s show IIRC.Riverdale and The Flash both fall into this category and last season so did Black lightening and Supergirl IIRC in Canada btwNo, they\\'re talking about Netflix. Netflix has the distribution rights to The Good Place in other regions.No. Because we are on a website where opinions are expected.It is, but they just want to make sure that you keep your subscriptions and not just subscribe for one show[deleted][deleted]Oh did it? I thought it wasn\\'t a release day titleDon\\'t mind meYeah, our son is 15 months and so our only potential TV time is after he goes to bed. Then once he\\'s in bed it\\'s time to deal with everything around the house, then we generally put a show on and I fall asleep in the middle.Except you\\'re replying to a person who says weekly schedules are better, and you disagree for the Mandalorian. So...If you want people to keep their subscription, produce better shows, you don\\'t have to force them by releasing weekly episodes that are already released...weak move. Netflix is basically giving away 30 free trails. Disney trail is only 7 days and they are scared of people leaving? Give the people what they want and you don\\'t have to be scared of them leaving. I want Disney to win the steaming war, but this is not the way. Disney has way better content than Netflix, so you don\\'t have to be so scared of losing subscription or people taking advantage of the free trial.Not sure why me preferring to binge watch a show have anything to do with me not being in the buisness industry...Me simply saying what people do is not an advocacy for it.Care to point me to proper opinion etiquetteActually Netflix stopped the 30-day free trial so Disney is doing it \"better\" right now..[deleted][I\\'ve got you.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language)No, is still going on. What you talking about https://www.netflix.com/signup \"You won\\'t be charged until after your free month.\"[removed]Still doesn\\'t explain why does that have anything with me not being in the buisness industry...I binge watch because I don\\'t like waiting one week for a new episode, I can\\'t binge watch the entire show in one day and you can only use the free sub once. Why should I keep a service active for months just for one show assuming that\\'s the only show I\\'m subscribing for.The word opinion is only referenced once and it doesn\\'t say anything about opinion etiquetteThey said that they stopped it.. Maybe it is just in my country..That\\'s weird. [Try this one.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joke)Nope. That is unrelated too. Do you have trouble finding it? I will help youI can\\'t watch Parent Trap (1961) or Newsies or some PJ Masks via Chromecast either. I don\\'t know why. Support said it must be my internet speed but everything else works!I had this happen for The Princess Diaries and Steamboat Willy for months.They both worked just fine if I played It on my phone, but error if i tried to cast. Even when downloaded.Honestly,  no idea what happened as it randomly let me cast both like a week ago and nothing had changed on my end.Are you using a built-in Chromecast device, or a plug-in. In case of the latter, it could be a bad connection or damaged device.I tried the built in SmartCast by Vizio and plug in Chromecast (3rd gen) and it\\'s happening to me :/North Carolina charges sales tax on streaming services.It\\'s whatever your local sales tax rate is (which is the state rate plus county and/or city). The highest rate in the state is 7.5%; the lowest is 4.75% (state plus zero local).I don\\'t pay monthly but if the tax is 7% then that\\'s $7.48 a month.Yes, it looks like North Carolina charges state tax for streaming services. https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/52446679I think NC had a 7% tax rate for streaming. So that adds about an extra $5 ($74.89). I doubt that it would be more than $77-$79 total.Do you have kids? I would honestly suggest waiting until August when the lineup picks up if not.Do you even pay taxes?I don\\'t thanks for the advice i\\'ll hold out till then i guess!Yes, However, I am 19 and still dependent on my parents but I have a job and I am doing community college.They have a decent amount of issues, missing features, etc. Many shows are out of order. Nearly all new content each month is documentaries or unscripted. The library content is still full of gaps and not being filled quickly. In January they added 35 titles on the 1st. This is more in line with Netflix and Hulu and Starz and gave me GREAT hope for the future. Then in February they added 4 new titles on the 1st. March 1st they are scheduled to add 2. It honestly breaks my heart to see how much they are blowing it. Yes, they also add titles throughout the month but that still speaks volumes (or lack thereof).August brings Falcon and Winter Soldier. If you aren\\'t into Marvel I\\'d say don\\'t even get it until Christmastime.  Between now and August the only shows left to premiere that aren\\'t reality / documentary are Mighty Ducks in May. But also if reality / documentary is your thing then you might actually love this.I\\'m not sure if this sub is the right one to ask about local sales tax and subscription prices, but if you pay any other bills (phone, internet, monthly cheese club, &c.) I suspect that the percentage is the same.Maybe ask your parents how much they pay for other subscriptions...I sang into the unknown the moment I read the title for the first episodeI can hear you but I won\\'tDoes this show continue any threads from Clone Wars/Rebels or is it it\\'s own thing entirely?Is this show any good?FINALLY!   Binged S1 a week after D+ launched, so really lookin forward to this when I get home!!!!I was disappointed that they never did anything with the plot thread with the force sensitive kids. I\\'m guessing they had something planned when they first introduced it, but then they only got two seasons and didn\\'t have time for it to go anywhere.Art style is a deal breaker for meMy first thought too.Some look for troubleIt\\'s is its own thing (there is an era difference anyway) and I am yet to see a reason to why it exists.It’s not bad. In my opinion it’s better for a younger audience.  Not much to captivate older  Star Wars fans.Its alright. IMO some episodes were better than the Rebels ones.  More for young kids IMO and did not tie into or expand the new movies as much as I would have liked.My usual answer: it depends.Are you a child or watching with a small child? then Yes. The show is almost entirely one dimensional characters and lots of slap stick humor.Do you care about watching as much canon as possible? Then obviously it\\'s a must.Is BB-8 your only reason to get up the morning? Then S1 is a must-watch.Otherwise, not at all. The characters grow very little. The show is about space racing and leading up the ST, neither of which it really ends up doing. It only tangentially ties into the ST in the end anyway.The ONLY impact it\\'s had on the great SW universe is that 4 ships from the show are in the giant space battle over Exegol -- and you can\\'t even pick them out.NoIt’s okay, the first like 5 episodes all suck. Once the first order gets involved it gets a lot more interesting.YesWhile others don’tNot for Disney+. But for Hulu you can go to https://secure.hulu.com/account and scroll to Manage Devices and remove any you don\\'t recognize. Change your password before you remove the devices.Yes, to change your payment method you would have to cancel, it will take effect at the end of the month you last paid for, then once it ends you’ll see the option to resubscribe through iTunes to use your iTunes payment method. You could also change your payment method to be your card directly through the website so that regardless of what phone you have it just charges your card instead of through the App Store of the phone you have.Hard to tell. Several \\'90s films for Disney Channel and Wonderful World of Disney were only licensed or co-produced by Disney. The controlling distributor of *H.E. Double Hockey Sticks* is a company named \"Big W Productions.\" A lot of TV and films are caught up in ambiguous legal standing because production houses come and go and their properties are not always transferred, or they revert back to a previous owner, or whatever.Disney may very well own the film and rights. But a *complete* lack of home video release is not a good sign.Yes.Disney doesn\\'t own it, so not likely. There is a slim chance they could strike a deal with Sony to get all the Spidey content on Disney+, but for now Sony has an exclusive deal with Starz and we don\\'t know what\\'s going to happen after that expires.Probably not barring a Sony - Marvel deal. That’s my absolutely favorite Spidey show and it has the best intro song.Unfortunately no. Sony still owns Spider-Man and that show was somewhat still under Sony jurisdiction. Other Spider-Man shows were under Fox and Marvel/Disney though.It\\'s on CrackleI would love that.  Spectacular is still my favorite Spider Man cartoon of all time.  The second is the old one from the 60s, that a lot of memes are made from.  I wonder if Disney will put those original 60s Spider-man and other heroes cartoons.Disney probably doesn\\'t want people to see how much better it is than their Marvel cartoons.Very unlikely given that, as others have said, they would need to strike a deal with Sony. That said if you go into Help > Give Feedback and then pull up \"Request a film or show\" you can try requesting Spectacular Spider-Man to at least voice your opinion. Effectiveness may be slim to none but it\\'s quick and can\\'t hurt.LOL 😂 You fool.Totally agree, it is the best Spiderman show for meOnly time will tell... And maybe entertainment weekly some dayThanks for the recommendationLet me dream :(Sorry, It was free or is free on the app Crackle a Sony Streaming service US App with ads.I heard someone say in a different thread that some tv network had the rights but I honestly dont know ;( I hope it comes soon, it\\'s one of my favorites!Anything Disney-made without a placeholder is 2022 or later. The weird thing is, as you said, it\\'s not available ANYWHERE else to stream online. I don\\'t know if it\\'s a TV deal but maybe so. That makes sense. If you noticed, Fox films don\\'t get those placeholders, but Disney ones (including Touchstone, etc) seem to get placeholders if they\\'re coming before 2022.Here\\'s a list on what the error codes mean.https://www.techradar.com/how-to/disney-plus-error-codes-explainedError Code 41 – Playback issueThis occurs when the Disney Plus servers are feeling the strain of everyone trying to download the same show or movie. You can try to resolve this one by rebooting the device or signing out and signing in again. And you might need to be patient while they try to fix the issue. Go spend time outside!Thank you so much!\"love, victor is too adult for Disney+\"If that\\'s the case then HOW is The Simpsons still on there?That\\'s the second series to get moved from Disney+ to Hulu (the first being High Fidelity).What the heck is wrong with them? There\\'s already not enough new drama shows on the service. So Love Victor is too ‘mature’ for Disney Plus yet theyl have a series about a bounty hunter (mando) , a show where a girl almost gets drugged and raped (marvels runaways), an animated show that curses every 2 minutes (Simpsons), and a movie with Nazis (rocketeer/captain America)This is a move layered with hypocrisy. Shows like the simpsons and marvel films are more mature than the Love, Simon film was, the rating for this show would have had to shoot way up for this move to be understandable. We\\'ll see how that unfolds but it would have to be something substantial. Furthermore does disney+ even realize how much of a douche bag move this looks like? No the other gay characters on disney+ don\\'t make this decision look less stupid, this would\\'ve been a huge moment for Disney\\'s flagship tv service.And as an international disney+ user it really annoys that they Disney moved this from their global service to their US-only service.Let\\'s move this series from the worldwide Disney+ to the US only Hulu.Yup, that makes sense. 😔I’m glad to see that the show is coming along, but is pretty sad to me that Disney is not willing to a have a show like Love Victor associated with the Disney+ brand. Love Simon demonstrated very accurately the struggles of coming out and being gay in high school. This is just another example of Disney execs not willing to take a stand on LGBT diversity and inclusion in major projects.If they\\'re going to insist on keeping Disney+ sterile and bland like this the service isn\\'t going to survive.    Also makes me kind of worried the MCU shows could be bland AF too.Do they know that endgame has a big purple guy getting his head cut off?Yea, I’m not happy that a show originally made for Disney Plus is going to be moved to Hulu. Personally, I think Disney Plus needs to be more open and willing to create content that’s more mature but still family friendly enough that anyone can watch it. It is a bit hypocritical that Disney is moving this show to Hulu when they have shows like Boy Meets World and The Simpsons where many times they deal with more mature themes and ideas. But also there are quite some shows on Disney Plus that are more mature for an older audience like The Simpsons and Wicked Tuna. Wicked Tuna features a lot of swearing, language that wouldn’t be family friendly according to Disney. In conclusion to my long semi-rant, I want Disney to be willing to make shows and films that feature more mature themes and ideas. I love having a majority of my Disney content in one place with variety. Removing “Love, Victor” from their catalogue makes me disappointed in Disney.Having watched High Fidelity I see why they moved that but the reasoning for this seem not worth it but I\\'ll have to watch it to truly see why they made the decision.Wtf are you serious see this is why I didn’t want Disney to buy fox it’s sad enough that they are changing the name of the company that so many people like me grew up on I swear if I had the money I would buy them outI just want to point out Disney’s hypocrisy: Marvel’s Runaways on Disney+ also features underaged drinking and drug use. I don’t know about the parents’ subplot, but Runaways, again, has parents who cheated on their spouse and even killed people. I can only believe this is homophobia from Disney. I will still support the show on Hulu, but the corporate execs are definitely in the wrong here.Does Disney have a parental lock or \"mode\" like Netflix?If not then it makes sense. I\\'d rather a realistic edgy teen show than some watered down mid 2000s sanitised experience.I really don\\'t understand why they don\\'t just add an age restricted system to Disney+ and force people to use a sign in to watch stuff like this or whatever they deem necessaryWorth noting they cut gay scenes from hsmtmts, cancelled a show about two gay couples called ‘four dads’, and promised three seasons of andi mack when most of the series is missing.Shame on Disney for moving Love, Simon / Love, Victor from Disney+ to Hulu.This is a clear manifestation of the homophobia of Disney.Shame on Disney!That’s a shame :(😔HOW HAVE I NOT HEARD OF THIS OH MY GOD THEY GOTTA MAKE LEAH ON THE OFFBEATGreat news. Inappropriate for a family service.Can\\'t have those filthy gays besmirch our beloved Disney brand.Is that what the article says?!They have Bart Simpsons uncensored p e n I s  in the Simpsons movie on disney+ but removed a key scene in Guardians of the Galaxy that said the word d I c k.High Fidelity I understand, it’s got full frontal nudity and constant f-bombs. This new one, I don’t understand so much.People think of Disney as being for kids. These two new shows are clearly not for kids.I feel like Disney+ is never going to have any significant drama offerings. Drama, horror and R-Rated stuff will go to Hulu. I think Disney expects people who want those will get both services.Disney are spoiled and they feel like nothing can touch them they are like the kid in the sandbox who hogs all the good toys to themselves and won’t shareCause Disney knows the 🏳️\\u200d🌈 community will support them no matter what so why risk pissing annoying conservatives.No if they actually took a stand and stopped going to Disneyland and buying $25 Minnie headbands and $110 tickets then maybe Disney would do something.Too mature.It sucks, but they added Runaways to D+! That\\'s a positive thing since it means we might get it eventually.LS works so well, because it is a great teen film, period. It was able to tell a story about coming out that alot of people (myself included) have no real insight on, and were able to tie it in with great writing, characters and updating John Hughes-like tropes were used to.Bland is the perfect description.It\\'s possible the show runners/producers wanted the freedom to further explore homosexuality beyond a PG-13 rating. If a show actually explores sex in any way, be it hetero or homo, then it\\'s not going to be on Disney+. I don\\'t think that\\'s crazy or unexpected.20 Century Studios wasn\\'t always 20th Century Fox...Because fox is still a company you know the news for example? Disney didn\\'t buy all of fox.For what it\\'s worth they have lesbian kisses and relationship in the runaways but I wonder if they know thatI don\\'t think it\\'s possible. Leah on the Offbeat was set in Senior year, and Simon vs the HSA was set in Junior year, but the movie moved the story to Senior year, so unless they make the sequel set in a college we\\'re both Leah and Abby are together, I doubt it\\'ll happen.Nope your homophobia is a inappropriate.Why?\"Great news. Inappropriate for a family service.\" - You in the 20th century, regarding a show with a black character.Believing that representation for gay kids is \"inappropriate for a family service\" is no different from believing that representation for black kids is \"inappropriate for a family service\", because of the fact that both race and orientation are biological traits.You are an ignorant homophobic hatemonger. Shame on you.Wow. Such wild responses here. Genuinely surprised by the amount of downvotes.Look guys, kids shouldn\\'t even know that homosexuality is a thing that exists in the world. Anyone telling kids about sex (and doing it with their own gender for that matter) is messed up in the head. Kids deserve to be innocent, and they deserve to live lives free of such social issues. Until they grow older. So I stand by what I said. This show belongs on Hulu, and it\\'s great news that it\\'s not coming to Disney+ because it\\'s inappropriate for a family-oriented streaming service.Thanks to those who have remained civil on here! And to those of you who felt like you needed to send me a PM telling me that I\\'m \"evil\" and \"vile\" for holding a moral, traditional perspective about sex, maybe you need to look in the mirror and think about who\\'s the *real* intolerant one here. 🙂Love you all!\"Can\\'t have those filthy blacks besmirch our beloved Disney brand.\" - You in the 20th century.You are an ignorant homophobic hatemonger. Shame on you.Yes!!!This isn\\'t true. Just watched it, they absolutely left the \"they got my dick message!\" And the \"Idk if anyone\\'s 100% a dick, ma\\'am\" Lines in there.Oh did they actually do that?Which ep has this? I don\\'t recall ever seeing nudity of any kind in the simpsons. Curious why they would do that though.No they didn\\'t.They did what????I haven\\'t seen High Fidelity so I can\\'t comment, but I would imagine that was stuff they added at a later point. It was also created and originally written as a Disney+ Original, so it probably didn\\'t have that stuff in it in the beginning.It\\'s also probably a big reason why we didn\\'t have a \\'flagship\\' Original show for January/early February. That was supposed to be High Fidelity.It\\'s literally about high school kids. The original movie was PG-13, and the book it\\'s based on is in the \"young adult\" section. How is that \\'too mature\\'? It\\'s arguably even MORE aimed at kids/teens than something like The Mandalorian because it\\'s directly about the kind of stuff that you deal with while growing up.Not to mention the show was CREATED for Disney+. Did the person who created it not notice it was \\'too mature\\' until after it was done? That doesn\\'t make sense.The only explanation I can come up with is that some executive got cold feet about putting a show on Disney+ with an LGBTQ main character. Heaven forbid we expose our children to reality once in a while.Disney needs to be more than \"just for kids\".This show will definitely be fine for kids. Disney doesn’t want a show about a gay character. If the alcohol use in the simpsons is fine, this will be fine too.\"People think of Disney as being for kids. These two new shows are clearly not for kids.\" - You in the 20th century, regarding shows with black characters.You are an ignorant homophobic hatemonger. Shame on you.\"Too mature.\" - You in the 20th century, regarding a show with a black character.You are an ignorant homophobic hatemonger. Shame on you.Canadian here, and as much as I love Disney+ they don\\'t seem to say anything about us. Not about what\\'s coming, or leaving, and we don\\'t even have our own social media handles. Just have S1 of Runaways here. I have hope that things will change soon, but for now it\\'s very annoying.Oh I’m sure but never did I ever think in my lifetime they would ever change for the worse. As I said before the studio was know for great story telling but now with the mouse backing them they are slowly starting to suckIt\\'s all there in full glory unchanged, which makes this decision even more WTF.eh maybe at least \"the upside of unrequited\" it takes place in the same universe and abby is it inThat\\'s a wild accusation from a stranger on the internet. I love my gay friends. But that doesn\\'t mean I think alternative lifestyles should be shoved down the throats of children just trying to enjoy clean TV. Children deserve to live innocent lives, and Disney+ should remain a children\\'s streaming service. 🙂Why does depicting homosexuality inherently have to be about sex? Kids are shown heterosexual relationships their entire lives, even in children specific media. I don’t see why kids can’t see an innocent gay couple on screen. Homosexuality isn’t a social issue, people are just ignorant because they are kept in the dark, and learn from those who are uneducated. So really I feel like this show would do a lot of good.\"Look guys, kids shouldn\\'t even know that black skin is a thing that exists in the world. Anyone telling kids about race (and doing it with another race for that matter) is messed up in the head. Kids deserve to be innocent, and they deserve to live lives free of such social issues.

Shame on you.Lmao deleted your account because you completely missed the pointSarcasm bro.That\\'s one of the stupidest things I\\'ve heard.Then it was added back. It was missing like a week agoNoreally? wow this service keeps letting me down...Yeah. And I\\'m pissed because it\\'s literally the pivotal scene that tells you how and why the Nova corps help the guardians.It was in the Simpsons MovieWhich is even weirder — the novel it’s based on is very R-rated, as is the original film adaptation with John Cusack. Don’t know why they even tried fitting this story into Disney+ from the beginning.Well, Diary of a Future President was released in January and it\\'s ending now in March, so it\\'s not like they didn\\'t had anything.I think the highschool musical series has a lgbt character. I can\\'t remember because I stopped at episode 3. Mandalorian and HS musical don\\'t do well back-to-back.I blame Disney\\'s over reliance on making money from countries that are anti LGBT (not just China guys, other homophobic countries exist.)As far as I understand it Disney + is trying to tighten up its brand while also supporting Love, Victor. They WANT the show to tackle the really hard stuff rather than cage it to the lighter end of PG-13. I think the (minor)) backlash has actually looked at it the wrong way. Disney still is making this show but doesn’t want to hold back on the tough stuff just so they can show it on their family friendly app. I find this quite pro LGBTQ+. Don’t hold back, don’t sugar coat things. Also they feel the show will have a larger viewership since their target audience is more likely subscribed to Hulu. I think all bodes well for the longevity of the show. Something Disney obviously wants. Disney + has gay characters and more coming. Andi Mack for one and even on Fancy Nancy which is for preschoolers.That’s what Disney saidAnd some of the movies and shows have French text for some reason. I get that it’s technically our second language, but I’m pretty sure the majority of us outside Quebec aren’t *that* proficient in French.they have disneyplusca on Twitter but never activated it. it\\'s sad. I don\\'t understand their lack of communication and consistency. meanwhile they activated the European accounts but left Austria and Germany\\'s unused...I\\'m Peruvian. We don\\'t even have D+ yet. I\\'m using an account from a family member who lives in the USA, but still, I think they will eventually add it, specially in International markets without Hulu. The only reason that other show, High Fidelity, won\\'t it\\'s because is rated r and has nudity from what I\\'ve heard. I don\\'t think this one will tho, because up until now it was a D+ production, so it could happen just like with Runaways. And I hope Cloak and Dagger too.I know. That\\'s why I said what I said. Books good, they for a movie they\\'d need to do it in a college setting then and I don\\'t know if they would.You do realize there a kids being raised by same sex couples who grow up straight. Also saying that Disney+ is just of children is funny because \\'\\'The Simpsons\\'\\' are definitely not for kids.You clearly do not \"love\" your supposed gay \"friends\", because you hate gay people.You are no different from a racist that says \"I love my black friends\".Minority orientations are no more \"alternative lifestyles\" than minority races, because of the fact that both race and orientation are biological traits.The phrase \"alternative lifestyles\" is a pejorative term used against gay people by christians.Your hate should not be shoved down the throats of children.Your hate is not clean.Gay children are children too.Gay children \"deserve to live innocent lives\" away from your hate.Representation for gay kids does not change the status of Disney+ as a \"children\\'s streaming service\" anymore than representation for black kids changes the status of Disney as a \"children\\'s streaming service\", because of the fact that both race and orientation are biological traits.\"I love my black friends.

Shame on you.I just watched it a few weeks ago and it was there, so unless they removed it for literally a week...It\\'s not true. The scene is still in there.Either you confused the scene, are experiencing a regional difference, or made this up.Is it that one scene where John C Reilly was asked why they should help the Guardians (something about not being an A-Hole?)Yeah and most of their scenes were cut unfortunately. After they promoted them of course.Yeah, but he wasn\\'t the main character. Disney\\'s never had an LGBT person as a main character before, as far as I know.Then they should just not put the show on those countries\\' versions of Disney+they couldn\\'t, a main part of the plot is the college visitThe scene is completely intact. Disney+ has not edited anything from the marvel movies.Yeah. And its just gone from Disney plus when I watched it with my dad the other dayThat\\'s interesting—is there a thread about this?Disney seems terrified of reactionary backlash, and it\\'s not a good look for them.That\\'s what I\\'m saying! It\\'s not hard Disney!Exactly. That\\'s why I said it too. It\\'s just too much change and it would be completely different.Probably not,  cause they are not made by Disney.  The Spider-man movies are produced by Sony. They are MCU movies,  but not Disney ones.Thankfully, it’s rumored the Incredible Hulk movie rights have reverted back to Disney, but that doesn’t mean they can stream the universal film.They’re more concerned about getting their Disney films and series on the service that they own right now. They still have a long ways to go to get their properties away from Netflix and WarnerMedia’s channels and streaming services. I doubt they would take time to license the rest of the marvel studios collection from Sony for Spiderman and NBCUniversal for Hulk at the moment.There’s bigger fish to fry.I thought they made a deal for SpiderMan Homecoming  to eventually be on D+ but I could be wrong. Crackle isn’t going to go very far. I suspect Sony will make a deal if one is not signed already from that entire SpiderMan chaos.Definitely. They aren\\'t stupid, they\\'ll make a deal. But we\\'re years out.Season 2 doesn\\'t even start airing in Australia until march 17th sadly. I don\\'t know when they\\'ll air it on disney junior. Also August 1st will see a flood of Bluey toys in the north american market as well as UK from what I\\'ve seen.We all love this show so much. My wife tells me I parent a lot like Bandit. I take it as the highest of complimentsThe best part about this show is that the parents are always doing laundry. It cracks me up every time.Same our kids love this show. Can\\'t count how many times during this show my wife and I while watching with the kids find ourselves saying omg that\\'s us lol.Prob my favorite theme song of all the cartoons my son watchesgreatest show on disney!Absolutely the best find for us on D+. My wife acknowledges that it’s silly to aspire to a cartoon dog family.turned this one on today with my 1 year old for the first time. it\\'s.. actually enjoyable?Best show hands downr/bluey! We love the show but were sad to find out that Disney edits out some great jokes. I hope we can get tosee the original versions in the US some day.Huge fan. The plots are so well thought out!The imaginative play they show off is so good. I feel really bad for their neighbors, especially the magic asparagus episode...I love this show!Were have you heard about toys in August? I am very intrigued!Bluey!!Still available in the U.S.That sucks. I really liked the original as a kid. I remember the song \\'candle on the water\\' quite vividly.Couldn\\'t care less about the remake though....so I seriously cannot understand why they\\'d have to remove the original...I was afraid of that... apparently Disney thinks that we Dutch are only interested in recent Disney channel live-action garbage and not in the more classic properties :-(It\\'s no Mary Poppins, but some of the songs are so very memorable. Snatches from the songs are always popping into my head like \"I swear I saw a dragon,\" or \"can\\'t you hear that jingle-jangle sound...\"And that other one, what was it? Passamahassee, no that\\'s not it. Umm, Quasimapassee... Hrm, that\\'s not right either...This is literally my favorite Disney movie of all time! I was soooo disappointed in the remake, I watched the first 5 minutes and had to cut it off. They reunited it so dang bad.Passamaquoddy ;-)I couldn’t finish watching it either. IMO opinion the only remake they’ve gotten right was beauty and the beast. I went in there with extremely high expectations and they were met. Yeah maybe Emma Watson was auto tuned but idc about that. They kept the story and integrity of the original while adding a few details that made it a more fleshed out story. They haven’t done that with any of the other remakes.Yes!! I totally agree!! I was so disappointed with the new Lion King and not excited at all about the new Mulan. Maybe they can get Little Mermaid right?One can hope lolI apologize to the UK residents... that is really unfortunateSky and its monopoly over everything that gets imported here needs to END asap. Really infuriating.No subscription for me in that case. Shame.> This suggests that Disney films, including Marvel Cinematic Universe and Pixar releases, will remain on Sky until 20201. Having to wait 18 thousand years I think is a touch unreasonableWon\\'t somebody please think of the children!Does it stream on Sky\\'s service? It definitely isn\\'t on NowTV.I guess the Sky’s the limitOofThe article says the MCU and Pixar won\\'t be on there until 20201.That\\'s...a very long time.How does this confirm it? He said that The Simpsons will still be on Sky, nothing about exclusively.That\\'s a dealbreaker for me, no longer signing up to the pre-order.I tweeted the interviewer because he said this: > Me: “There’s been so many people expecting The Simpsons to launch on Disney+, but is that going to be staying on Sky for the time being?> Zai: “Simpsons is on Sky. Absolutely.” I said, somewhat optimistically, if he means that The Simpsons will still air new episodes on Sky with older seasons being on D+. Will update with a response.Not signing up thenIsn\\'t is just due to an existing agreement, and it will be available after it ends? There are tons of those on the US version.Haw haw!Give us young ones and we\\'ll talk.I’m writing this comment of regret while watching The Simpson’s on Disney+.[removed]Unless I\\'m missing something, it\\'s not actually \"confirmed\". I spoke to UK Disney Plus support today and they\\'re adamant that no statement has been made, nor a final launch content list released.Spoke to Disney Plus yesterday and they confirmed that the show will be on Disney Plus UK from launch.The article here just states that the Simpsons will remain on Sky. Nothing here about it not appearing on D+.Urgh. This is just unacceptable.So surely this means that Sky holds the streaming rights in the UK? Yet they don\\'t provide The Simpsons or Futurama on Now TV.Update: we are getting the Simpsons!Until they fix the aspect ratio it\\'s not that much of a loss imo.[deleted]Pfft. The episodes are cropped anyway.You mean: I apologise...I agree but also observe the irony of calling Sky a monopoly when Disney released its Netflix killer hahaha But, in saying that, without Sky we wouldn’t have access to HBO content and some of the premieres.  Services like HBOMax, Hulu, Peacock and CBSAA aren’t launching in the U.K. so it’s good the shows on there at least have an avenue for U.K. viewers. I think Sky needs to radically change its business model and go to focusing more on streaming. The amount of money it must take to operate and maintain satellites is wild, and their Sky over Broadband isn’t hitting the U.K. until at least Q4 21.If it is not coming to D+ my guess would be that Sky will likely have an old legacy deal (or even life of the series deal) for The Simpsons - my guess being they get first option/refusal on showing a new season... which is what it’s still not available on demand or catch up as it’s probably still party to whatever old agreement Sky made with 20th Century Fox tv at the time. Sky will probably have made that deal back in the pre-Disney days and to be honest they have absolutely no reason to give it up. And if that is the case then its incumbent upon Disney to offer a price to buy that option from Sky.Sky really clutching onto that IPIt does not.HahahahahahakillmehahahahahahahI’m getting mixed messages here because, having listened to the interview, Zai was asked “So will the Simpsons be on Sky?” To which he responded “Yes, the Simpsons will be on Sky”.  No mention on streaming rights for the Simpsons or the backlog being on the service. Just that the show will continue to air on Sky.[removed]Vote with your wallet, my friend☺️It’s a bit more complex as the U.K. has 2 distributors for The Simpsons: Sky One (owned by Sky (owned in turn by Comcast)) and Channel 4.  Sky and Channel 4 both have their own streaming services: NowTV and All4 respectively.  Channel 4 has a sub licence from Sky to air the show but can’t put it on streaming. Now we get to the more complex part: Sky used to be owned by Fox, but Fox sold off Sky to Comcast when Disney bought them.  Now, the agreement between Sky and Fox is really between Comcast and Disney.  The Simpsons has never been available for streaming in the U.K., whereas in the US it was available on Hulu. The agreement between Comcast and Disney may expire soon, but U.K. fans of the show have no way of knowing.  Disney’s silence on this matter suggests that there are no plans to bring it to the service. I say that because Sky have said that the Simpsons will be on Sky, but whether or not this means new episodes will air on Sky, while the backlog of 30 seasons will be on Disney+, or if it means that Sky holds the rights for the near future, is anyone’s guess. I suppose U.K. fans will really have to wait until an official announcement from Disney+ confirming it either way.  I acknowledge that there are splash pages for similar content in the US, like a definitive date as to when a movie or show will be on the service, but if there is no page on the UK’s site it may suggest that the show is still a ways away from getting on the service, if at all.As did I, they said the same to me. I would absolutely love to be wrong here btw, but I think I’m going to temper my expectations until we get an official word.Futurama is on Prime.  It could be that Sky holds the rights but doesn’t want to do anything, it could be that part of the original deal between Fox and Sky granted Sky the ability to create a sub licence for Channel 4 as a way of generating more revenue, but did not provide for streaming (as that wasn’t a thing when it was created) or it could be that Sky does not own the streaming rights and in fact the show will be on Disney+ as it is in other locations, with new episodes getting first showing on SkyOne. The second of these could be an interesting thing to discuss because sublicensing was really the main way in which content sharing generated revenue.  Obviously, now with streaming and whatnot, it’s rare to find shows aired outside their network group.It doesn\\'t have to.TV contracts frequently limit other forms of exploitation even if the rights to some particular method aren\\'t granted to that provider.Hey! Not going to argue with that, and I never do mention them, but curious as to why? This is a fan subreddit and not bound by Disney, right? Or is this reverse psychology by the mods? Like is this a wink wink, nudge nudge? because I didn’t know the magic behind the “technology that must not be named” until I saw a mod post not to mention them. Which made me google what they do... and, well..LmaoI’d take cropped over non 😞It’s too late to apologize.>Disney released its Netflix killer hahaha It\\'s not going to kill Netflix, not even closeI would say they already are - all those new Sky branded channels they’re launching? That’s a strategy to support streaming, on demand (both Now TV and full fat Sky over Fibre) and a future when they are more likely to rely on their own content, their own acquisition/slate deals and not specifically on carriage of traditional pay tv channels from other companies like Discovery or ViacomCBS.Without the Sky deal you probably would have HBO\\'s own service like many other European countries. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO\\\\_Europe#Streaming\\\\_services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO_Europe#Streaming_services)My fear though is that The Simpsons isn\\'t the only thing Sky\\'s witholding from this service in the UK. They\\'re currently offering a subscription deal for a year but I doubt I can commit to that if what we get is a stripped back barebones copy of the American version.So the streaming rights are basically in Limbo because Sky aren\\'t using them?[removed]Yeah not holding my breath tbhA lot of the visual gags are not seen because of it. I watched the first two episodes before I wasn’t able to watch anymore. Disney is supposed to be changing them back to their original 4:3 aspect ratio in “early 2020”, but no update on this.It\\'s too late.Not just yet, no, but Disney owns an awful lot and they’re not going to stop buying studios just because they’ve got a streaming service. When all of their licensing deals end in the next few years, and Netflix’s backlog starts to dwindle, Netflix will need to produce more original content. Original content will undoubtedly cost more, so they’ll hike up the subscription cost.  That’ll have two effects: forcing people to leave Netflix, or Netflix producing outstanding originals.  Given their slate of recent shows and movies, however, the latter is the least likely. Disney can afford to price ridiculously low for 4K, 4 streams and a completely downloadable catalogue. Disney is focused on expanding its original IPs whereas Netflix is focused on developing new ones.  It’ll be interesting to see which one wins out.Gonna guess you don\\'t spend much time around kids. Parents don\\'t want to deal with their kids, so they turn to a screen to be a babysitter while they make pancakes or whatever. I dunno, I don\\'t have kids but all of my friends with kids seem to complain about how expensive babysitters are and that they don\\'t have enough pancakes in their life. Disney+ promises to keep kids busy for a while, be it from movies or shows, and they can turn on a documentary if there are concerns over kids being corrupted by Lion King. So pay Disney $8 a month and go make pancakes or whatever. But now the kids are always wanting to watch stuff on Disney+ and parents don\\'t get to watch as much on Netflix. Miss out on a few shows, while Disney gets their more parent-friendly content (star wars and marvel for this generation of parents) that\\'s still appropriate for kids to view, and Netflix ends up being canceled to buy more pancake mix or whatever.Now the parents are disconnected from Netflix and kids grow up with free access to everything Disney wants them to watch. The current adults without kids won\\'t change over except to watch the new Mandalorian and Marvel shows once a year. But that\\'s not the market Disney is going after and they know that they\\'ll get their target market to convert. Think about it. Disney+ is on Switch but Netflix isn\\'t. Disney sees a purpose in getting in front of youth as soon as possible and is making it as easy as possible. No parent can stand in front of that for long.Also in this story pancakes is a metaphor for any of the following: alcohol, time to play games, sexy time, or pancakes. My buddy had a kid around a year ago and all she whines about is how she hasn\\'t had any of those things since then. The infant doesn\\'t get Disney+, the 6 year old does, but the point stands.I don’t think Sky over Fibre is coming until 2021. I’ve heard through the grapevine that they’re waiting until everywhere in the U.K. has fibre.Is that not what I said?It’s not “withholding” if they have a contract that Disney will have to honour - and Sky are under no obligation to give anything up either - if that means Toy Story 4 is exclusive to Sky until Summer 2021 then Disney just have to wait until the pay tv window is over. And aside from movies which granted is a fairly large number (and a lot of those are non exclusive with some simultaneously on Disneylife), there’s not really a significant amount of exclusive content Sky hold that belongs to Disney apart from a few shows like Modern Family and Grey’s Anatomy that would never go to D+... I think it’s quite overstated to be honest.I think so, yes.  It really doesn’t make sense because most people getting Disney+ will either subscribe to Sky or NowTV anyway so it isn’t a “one or the other” type situation. Not to mention that Disney+ is getting SkyQ integration so it isn’t like The Simpsons is a sort of ace that Sky can pull out.  From Sky’s perspective, it’s just a crappy anti-consumer move. But, they are a Comcast company so.I mean, yeah maybe a couple, but I grew up with the later (widescreen) episodes anyway.   For the U.K., it’s at a 0:0 aspect ratio 😂Woooahh ahhhhhhIt\\'s not happening especially with his limited it is. Hell they removed \"love Viktor\" a drama about growing up, and delves into various topics that kids should be aware about anyway and put it on Hulu. A platform that still isn\\'t worldwide. Their content is limited it\\'s not going to kill any service in the slightest.I can’t see it coming anytime soon but by all accounts it will still arrive at some point.... that being said they’re making changes such as massively investing in their own content and studio space, a deeper HBO deal with more co-pros and deals with BT... I think means of delivery will naturally evolve but for them, an arsenal of content is more important over the next few years in case partners choose to go their own way with their own platforms.While that’s true about shows not being on Disney+, Hulu is going to roll out internationally next year so Disney will start to claw back its content.  Legacy shows like Greys, Lost, etc will all have a permanent streaming home on Hulu.  Not to mention all of the FX stuff + other licensed content that Disney gets the rights to because they cost pennies (relatively of course). Similar to how Prime operated in its early-ish days, and Netflix to some extent as well.🤣 I gotcha.Hulu isn’t available worldwide yet, but I’m certain it will be. In fact I think Iger said something about it by 2021.Yes he did! [ “So we don’t have specifics, except we do plan to begin rolling Hulu out, I’d say probably in 2021 — internationally that is — after the Disney Plus launch,” he added.](https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/05/disney-aims-to-launch-hulu-internationally-in-2021/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9lbi5tLndpa2lwZWRpYS5vcmcv&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAG8suRoo5Hg9C-H_BNyA6RBg98QtRXuEWpwnjVzDCyCaJ6ccPys7EO2e2AEd1zHUjlxVa7VzvKtMfuL5zTm0XepE_Tw2QwN1URspXHjef3uaKXkodrooIzG-Q99LyI9ZOUXMpqEe3fV2R1sjb1btZd9BIm5femsjdrDYdrAlmnrI)I’m not going to hold my breath just yet re: Hulu.I see you have quoted Bob Iger in an earlier post where he said it would “probably roll out” from 2021 but that still seemed really non committal to me. The newer FX slate has been licensed to the BBC and based on some expiry dates, possibly until around 2023 and I really see those shows as a cornerstone of a Hulu platform. Plus most of Hulu’s existing originals do not actually belong to them anyway so it’s not as if they can just claw back Shrill, Ramy or Handmaid’s Tale which have been licensed elsewhere. Plus Fox’s other shows will be licensed all over the place so may not be repatriated immediately. I do expect to see some Hulu platform but personally not sure it will be as soon as 2021 - may be wrong of course but looking at Disney’s recent deal with Viaplay they are still appear to be pursuing a strategy of licensing their Fox and ABC slate in other countries which does appear at odds with the Hulu idea. https://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2020/02/17/nent-group-extends-disney-deal-for-viaplay-and-viasat/Doubt it. Either way Disney+ is limited, no mature content (doesn\\'t have to be R rated just PG13) most is just kiddy, Teeny crap.Oh well my bad. But again that means people have to pay for two different services. They should\\'ve branded the service differently so that there\\'s a wider rangee of content on there... Then maybe have a kids setting which hides content with a rating over PG13.Specifically for the U.K., I can see them buying back a lot of their deals because the networks are smaller. Starzplay which has Ramy, Channel 4 which has Handmaid’s Tale, etc are tiny in comparison to Sky.  I could absolutely see them buying back the licence to make its U.K. Hulu offering something worth subscribing to.They’ll no doubt make a deal for £9.99 which includes Hulu and D+ next year. Or price it at £89.99 for one year of Hulu with one year of D+. That’s still far cheaper than Netflix and will have a greater backlog of content from all of Disney’s networks like ABC, Freeform and FX. I wouldn’t be surprised if shows like Grey’s, AoS and AHS are all part of the allure for U.K. fans to get Hulu.  Incidentally, ABC properties all float between different providers because Disney keeps licensing them out; that’s why you’ve got box sets of Lost on Amazon, then NowTV, then Netflix, then back to Amazon.But they can’t buy Ramy and Handmaid’s Tale ‘back’. They don’t own those shows and they don’t sell/distribute them in international territories so they would only likely ever be available to them if their incumbent broadcasters (and Sky who have the SVOD on Handmaid’s) didn’t pick up their option - and Hulu would then have to negotiate for them as broadcaster - so can’t see it being as simple as them giving it the Big I Am and shaking down Channel 4 for stuff they don’t even own.ABC content that\\'s PG13 or under should go to Disney + not HuluI think buying back was the wrong phrase, I meant buying out of the license agreement.  I thought Hulu did own the shows, but I’ve just seen the main producer of Handmaid is MGM Television, so it’s possible they own the show.I don’t think any of the shows I mentioned are PG13 except maybe AOS. And I think AOS *is* on D+It’s an easy presumption to make - I think some folks forget that TV sales (especially across the international market) have always been a very complex business and just because companies like Netflix have global rights does not mean the market has magically become simplified. https://www.channel4.com/press/news/emmy-winning-international-hit-handmaids-tale-returns-third-seasonThis does confirm MGM distribute internationally. I think going forward the vast majority of original things coming from Hulu will be Disney owned (via 20th Century, FX, Hulu Studios or ABC for example) - I personally think (and this is an opinion) the shows to watch for in terms of international sales will be High Fidelity and Little Fires Everywhere as these will be sold internationally by Disney...so whether they will be sold as normal or held back for a platform or slate deal will be interesting to watch.Rewatching while revisiting the bumpers sounds like a great nostalgic time. I might just do that myself with a bowl of popcorn! I can’t wait :)Wifey and I binge watched “Boy Meets World” with the same sentiment. We are likely a little older than you, based on your viewing selections, but it hits the feels in all the same ways. Glad you’re having a nice time!EDIT: I suppose mentioning you were born in the 2000s is also a good indicator of us being older than you. Ha!I know someone commented and asked what the regular price is but unfortunately I can\\'t see the comment anymore 😅The regular price is £59.99/69,99€ per year.Waiting for wider Europe release -_-Tempting.... Not as good a deal as the three-year subscription offered via D23 prior to the US launch, but tempting nonetheless.....Any updates on Scandinavia release yet?I’m gonna wait to see what the UK library is like first before I subscribeWhat was the original price ?So what content do we get?I know about 2 Marvel + 2 Star Wars shows every year. How many marvel and Star Wars movies do you get?In terms of Pixar, do we get all released movies?And is the Natural Geographic bit any good?Don\\'t do it. It\\'s a trap.When are they going to fix the freeze issue where I have to rewind or restart every 5 minutes?I did not see the yearly option. Is there one that includes Hulu?  And is the only overseas?It\\'s a shame theres no European alternative for Hulu for fox content etcWhether the UK gets The Simpsons or not is a deal breaker for me so I’ll definitely be holding off on subscribing until I know about that. I have serious doubts we’ll get the show, which is a shame!Will my DisneyLife sub switch over automatically or will I need to create a new account for plus?So when I click the pre-order button, it takes me back to the preview page rather than an actual sign up page. Any ideas?On it like a car bonnetWill this be available on PS4 @ launch?Can you use your **Disney+** subscription like **Netflix**  when travelling to other countries when abroad if they also have the service there?I can\\'t wait! I wish you could preorder the regular monthly options thoughapart from web based, is this going to be available in the UK on smart tvs? ive got a couple of LGs and a SamsungI thought this was an ad[deleted]They put Togo on the right... why? That movie was mediocre at best.Wow, that\\'s pricey compared to Australia - it\\'s $89.99 for a year here, which is equal to £46 or 55€  - not that Disney had much choice here, since the starting price of Netflix and the other big streaming service here (Stan) is $9.99 so they had to undercut that.Where are you from?I thought Europe was a common market? Can’t you just use any other EU country’s sign up page?That deal was also US only I believe.  I\\'m from Canada and even though the service launched at the same time we didn\\'t get the same deal.How’s it tempting it’s like 10€ off which is 0.8€ a month discount. Better to just stay with a monthly choice to cancel the subscription.Listen you guys get free health care, etc. Let us Americans have our discounted streaming servicesI wish I could tell you but I\\'m not from Scandinavia and I don\\'t work for Disney 😕Just got an email about the pre-order and the discount and thought I could share it with you guysStill March 31st unfortunately :(No Simpsons I believeI wasn\\'t able to see your comment till now.. The regular price is £59.99/69,99€ per year.Only Disney knows 🤷🏼\\u200d♂\\u200d[IT\\'S A TRAP!](https://gph.is/1KpXag6)Exactly,  I had it for a month, saw everything worth watching. Canceled it. I will probably do that from now on, once a year I\\'ll have D+ for a month to catch up on new releases.

It’s the tile that represents National GeographicGuess I\\'ll have to move to Australia now 🇦🇺GreeceNot that common. Doesn\\'t apply for streaming appsYep we couldn\\'t even pre order Disney plus here in CanadaApparently it’ll get Simpsons but it’ll take a year to get the latest oneI suppose so.I guess I’m seeing if any america/elsewhere people who already have Disney+ can answer any of those questionsR.I.P admiral ackbarAh. That sucks.  I subscribe to the bundle which includes Disney+ and Hulu for $12.99 a month.  But I am in America.Yeah I had an email that said the same thing, still waiting for updates, you’d have thought already being a subscriber for years we’d have had more info about what’s to become of our current accountI spoke to Disney Plus support and they said the Isle of Man was included though. But then they also said to try and get someone in the UK to sign up on my behalf 🤷🏻\\u200d♂\\u200d[deleted][removed][removed]Well that sucks 🤷\\u200d♂\\u200d, hope y’all get a better trade deal next timeSeriously?

Probably next year.I haven\\'t heard anything about it yet 🤷🏼\\u200d♂\\u200d[removed]**Please read this entire message**---> Your comment on r/DisneyPlus was removed due to a Rule 2 violation: \"No posts about piracy or VPNs.\" ---**If you believe this post was removed by mistake, please [contact the Moderators.](https://reddit.com/message/compose/?to=r/disneyplus&subject=Question%20About%20A%20Removal)****Violations may result in a temporary or permanent ban.**Yep pretty sure or maybe it was just me who was stupid and couldn\\'t figure out after like 5 hours of Tring to figure it outYes very trueI cannot imagine why.  Disney owns Hulu.  Do you have an alternative in Canada (or for those of you in Europe)?In Europe, other streaming services or TV channels have the rights for the shows that are exclusive to Hulu in the US. Some even are available on Amazon Prime (Handmaid‘s Tale for example).So if Disney decides to expand Hulu, they have to do so without many of their flagship shows. Netflix had a similar problem when they expanded: shows like House of Cards or Orange is the new black were already licensed to other channels (e.g. Sky had the rights to HoC in Germany and Netflix got new seasons only after IIRC 6 months).Yes, of course.So I will get 4K HDR?Like that\\'s the only response. Yes.If they\\'re offering it in 4K HDR and you have the speed to support it (and a TV/streaming device that support it).It depends on the content.Thanks for the confirmation, just wanted to know what I am getting for my money. Unlike Netflix there isn\\'t different quality packages to choose from. I have full fibre into the house so 300Mbps and a 60 inch OLED 4K HDR LG TV so everything needed to get best possible picture and sound.Only one package to choose from, you get a bunch of stuff in 4K, it seems like most of the new shows/movies are coming in 4K, and some older things have been redone in 4K.  When picking older things to watch, I’m only watching the ones in 4K. My hope is by the time I get through those that they’ll have converted something else I want to watch to 4K in the meantime.Do you have an adblocker installed? I had this problem before, I whitelisted the adblocker for Disney+ and it started remembering where I left off.I have the same issue when i switch between devices. Each device remembers where i left off on that specific device. Really annoying when i want to watch stuff on my phone on my breaks at work, but then have to figure out where i left off when i get home and put it on the tv.I have several. I will try that, thank you!!Mine doesn’t even save at all, though.This happens to me also. I just let in run it\\'s course. After a few seconds it automatically starts up again where it froze and plays normally from then on.There have been all sorts of complaints about D+ on PS4. Some people have seem an improvement after uninstalling and reinstalling the app.Dude, the PS4 app is bonkers due to all the glitches. For us, it stutters and buffers so much. Used to be, it would stutter and jump forward several minutes. After the recent update, it just stutters a *lot*; my solution to this is to pause for a count of 10 and unpause. But if it gets really bad, I have to fully exit out of the episode/movie, however since the update, that just fully restarts the episode/movie so I have to note the timestamp before doing that. It\\'s so annoying.Every time it happens, I say that Disney and Sony need to figure out their beef because this is ridiculous, even for a new streaming service.There’s an official statement that Disney+ will be launched in Austria on the same day as Germany. I’m subscribed to their newsletter and got 2 or 3 updates already which confirmed the 24th of March. That’s good enough for me. Don’t use Twitter or Instagram anyway so I’m not missing out on anything. If they say it’ll be launched it’s set and I expect the apps for every single respective platform to release soon.If memory serves me correctly I believe it will be on Disney+ tomorrow (Feb 25). At least in the U.S.Haven\\'t seen it, would an adult like it?For me, a hard core Star Wars fan, it really didn’t grab my attention until the very last episode of season 1. Now I’m excited for it to come to Disney+ to see the rest of the series.Tomorrow funny you should ask!Awesome. Guess I know what I\\'ll be doing tomorrowI\\'ve only watched Season 1, but just like it\\'s predecessors, Clone Wars and Rebels, it starts out playfully and gets more serious as it progresses. It feels a little more like a \"cartoon\" than the other two but it is still entertaining and there are moments that definitely feel mature enough to capture an adult\\'s attention span.Bear in mind, I love cartoons, even the kind that are not as adult-friendly. If on the other hand, cartoons tonally put you off (humor, expressions, exaggerated action), you may not stick around long enough to see the good stuff... but if it\\'s not to your taste that\\'s totally fine.It depends. A hardcore Star Wars fan would want to see it. It\\'s not as good as the Clone Wars or Rebels.It\\'s clearly made for kids. If you don\\'t like the main character, who\\'s an idiot except in the pilot seat or his friend and also idiot, an alien that takes everything literally, you probably aren\\'t going to like it.There is a handful of cool bits and designs but...Then again I only saw the first season, it might get better.Personally i have no experience as an adult, but if you like clone wars with an \"anime\" style of animation, then its probally good.K thanks I\\'ll try it outThe full series is there but listed as one series, is that what you’re talking about?90\\'s Spider-Man has the whole series jumbled into one long, confusing list. This page has the correct episode order:https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Spider-Man:_The_Animated_SeriesI was frustrated by this as wellYes after the UK launch, every Disney+ original will arrive on the same days as every other country but obviously the time change will be different.There\\'s a good chance new S2 content will be released in the UK first, like quite a few hours before North America.Everything releases at the exact same time regardless of location.> like quite a few hours... Okay?OctoberOk thanksHow come you didn\\'t answer their question when they asked who your favourite character is? :([Update?](https://imgur.com/a/DNzCWXd)I\\'m wondering if theres actually anything the UK get that the US don\\'t. So far i\\'ve just heard of us getting less.Want to know if we get Agents of Shield like the Netherlands. AOS isnt on Prime, Netflix or Sky Boxsets so theres no exclusivity I can think of.I don’t know what to believe anymore[Managing director of content said it won’t be available for foreseeable future](https://www.nme.com/news/tv/the-simpsons-is-not-coming-to-disney-in-the-uk-2614068)Deal breaker for me hopefully the info you got is trueI had it confirmed twice this afternoon that Simpsons would be on the service at launchhttps://i.imgur.com/j1LvOA3.jpgI contacted Disney+ they said \"I cannot guarantee that all seasons will be available. The list of contents is currently being extended. For sure there will be movies such as Lady and the Tramp(2019) and The Mandolorian.  I believe we will be able to stream the older seasons not sure if the movie will be on there eitherLol the other poster was the one who got asked, not me!  I’d have 100% gone Sideshow BobHaha I did and I answered Homer. i just wanted an answer to my first question first!I imagine some of the MCU films will be on. I know Disney’s movie deal with Sky runs out soon, at the end of February IIRC.Is he not talking about showing new episodes (season 31)? I think theres been some confusion, as no-one cares or expects to get brand new Simpsons on Disney+ right now. We just want classic Simpsons.That’s the managing director of Sky I think, not Disney.   I made another post where I referenced an Independent article, so I’m really confused.Im listening to the interview now.Weird that there’s no promotion for it.Oh my bad, and same.Oh lol no worriesAh yeah it is, just listening now. I imagine they’re frantically trying to sort a deal before the 24thJust finished listening; he doesn’t deny it’s coming to Disney+, he just said The Simpsons is on sky.It was the same in the Netherlands: no Simpsons in the Disney+ promotions.I think Sky would be, but for Disney, they own it. The money they would spend on buying out of that contract (maybe $100m) they’d make back in less than 2 months with Disney+ subscriptions in the U.K.Got a link?All good, found it!Was it on the service though?Hate sky. So so datedYes, all 30 seasons were available at launch. We are missing a lot of classic Disney content though that has been made available in other markets.Works fine in VirginiaHad to log out.... SMH ALWAYS FORGET THE BASICSGo to the rodeo while Disney+ is down lolMy kids loved Rollie Pollie Ollie, Stanley, bear in the big blue house, jo jo’s circus. I would love to see those come to Disney plus.Sabrina the animated series is currently available for free on Tubi.Are Bananas in Pajamas and Sabrina the animated series really Disney?I’ve been going through my VHS childhood hoard that I’ve kept for far too long, and I just realized that the 90’s show Really Wild Animals was made by National Geographic! So maybe I’ll put in a request for that series. Maybe there’s hope for it.[removed]Gotta love Tubi. I love the free streaming services so much. And I love that they’re legal!!Bananas in Pajamas was made by the Australian Broadcasting Company so I don’t think Disney owns it.Sabrina is a unique case. The show was made by DiC (Inspector Gadget, Heathcliff, and some Mario and Zelda cartoons) when they were owned by Disney. Now DiC is a part of WildBrain so I’m not sure Disney owns this one either.What happened to the Oswald series that was supposedly in development?Not enough new contentWhich Zorro show drops on the 13th...the original or the remake?ICE AGE BABY!Is Ice Age be available in the US? If yes very unexpectedOr why isn’t the Oswald old series on Disney+?1990s versionyes it will beLame.I don\\'t think so. We don\\'t have them in the Netherlands either. Tbh I asked quite a few times for the possibility of abc series to come to Disney Plus, but the consensus seems to be they will not be added :-(Disney Plus is great, but it would really benefit from the addition of more series. Young Indiana Jones, or any of the abc series like Avonlea, Young Riders and the more recent ones (like you mentioned) would be an amazing start. But it seems to be a little difficult regarding distribution rights etc..I wish they would but it doesn’t look like they fit with the Disney+ brand. Kinda annoying.So far the only ABC show on Disney Plus is Boy Meets World.I think we will, I hope soDisney has said they want to rollout Hulu in more regions. I suspect they are keeping these shows for that.> Does anyone know if they will have ABC shows such as Greys Anatomy and Black-ish will be on Disney+ because in the UK you can\\'t stream them anywhere.I watched them on Now TV - The Sky Streaming service.  Not currently available though.They’ll more likely stay on HuluDisney doesn\\'t own The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles.> Young Indiana Jones, or any of the abc series like Avonlea, Young RidersDisney doesn\\'t control *any* of those. * Young Indiana Jones - Paramount* Road to Avonlea - Sullivan Films/CBC* Young Riders - MGMJust because something aired on a Disney-owned channel does not mean Disney produced it or owns it. Disney didn\\'t even own ABC until 1996.I do believe most past seasons of Disney-produced family shows for ABC (and other networks) will eventually come to Disney Plus. But, because of international broadcast rights of current shows and syndication/streaming deals on other shows, there will always be a wait and some international differences.They do? Why? Hulu has always been a US-Canada-Japan exclusive club. Wouldn\\'t it be easier to have all Disney owned stuff on one app?Oh in the U.K. we dont have Hulu so it\\'s a bit of a sticky one where the ABC shows will go in the U.K.He said UK read it againI know. Hence my \\'distribution rights\\' remark. Still, Disney Plus is quite lacking in series so it would be nice if they\\'d acquire the rights of some of these series. They wouldn\\'t even be that expensive.Disney has made comments about wanting to roll Hulu out worldwide, but haven’t made any official announcement about it. So hopefully it will be worked on once the Disney+ roll out is completed.If PG13 content goes there when it arrives that\\'d be stupidThe thing is how are we going to watch our ABC content before next yeah?Change the audio output in the Apple TV from 5.1 to Stereo, should fix it.https://help.disneyplus.com/csp  or  follow the help button in app  then select give feedback.Edited to fixed addressThank you!Where\\'s the request page?

I think they\\'re not announcing anything because Disney has a deal with OSN in the region. OSN has a dedicated channel for Disney movies (OSN Movies Disney). And we don’t know when that licensing deal expires.Who knows? Disney doesn\\'t know. They hope to open to the rest of the world until the end of 2020 I believe and hope.I don’t think they have announced it but on the release in America they said they were hoping to get it out in “all major markets“ within 2 years so latest I would say is November 2021I also live in a country where Disney + isn’t available . According to press releases here they say within 2 yrs . Not sure why they don’t just release their new original content like Mandolorian for the whole world  to view . When we get it Yoda won’t be a baby anymore .:([removed][removed][removed]Can confirm. This is the major hurdle, considering the Disney catalogue is OSN\\'s main player.[removed]How do you know it\\'s been blocked if it hasn\\'t even launched in the UK yet?Because yearly subscription preorders are live?It appears they may just be numbered wrong. The episode list on Wikipedia shows 2 less episodes in season 1 total with what disneyplus shows as 4 and 5 numbered as 2 and 3.Yeah, the episodes are all there, in the proper order. Maybe they wanted to count *Tangled Before Ever After* as episodes 1-2, but forgot to change \"What the Hair?!\" to episode 3.I was confused by this as well but when I verified against Wikipedia was glad to see they actually are all there.Hm. Weird.  I wonder why? Thank you!No, it will not have everything. It will have a lot, but not everything. If there’s some Disney/Fox content that you feel so passionately about that you’d say “I’m so angry I bought this subscription when they don’t have ____”, just save yourself the aggravation and don’t buy in advance. Wait until it goes live and do a free trial.Not yet but eventually it will. At least that\\'s what Iger said. Maybe not Song of the South though.There are a lot of movies and shows available but some of them aren\\'t available due to licensing issues (EX: most of the 20th Century Studios library)No.Not yet, but it has a lot. Someday maybe.It contains the VAST MAJORITY of Disney movies and series. As you will see if you scroll through this subreddit, they are some missing things. (Side note: It is against the subreddit rules to post about missing shows or movies).Over all, Disney+ has basically everything.Try [this](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=does+disney+plus+have+every+disney+movie+ever)No, but it will have all the absolute necessities(Pixar movies, Star Wars, Frozen, Marvel, etc)Part in question:>\\tYour account switch from DisneyLife to Disney+ is not automatic, so to stream all your favourite Disney films and series from March 24th you will need to sign up for a Disney+ subscription.Perfect time to [pre-order for £49.99](https://preview.disneyplus.com/uk)What do you exactly mean?It launches on 24th of March will the PS4 app and fire tv app be out on the same day to download?99% yes. But it\\'s a matter of a few daysYes it\\'s now owned by Disney, but it may take a while to show up on there due to licensing issues.I don’t think you will miss much if it doesn’t come to Disney plus. I heard the movie was absolute garbage, and it bombed at the box office.$694,782 total at the box office.and it’s budget was $40m? damn that hurtsIf you have kids who you want to introduce to Disney\\'s huge legacy catalog or have specific shows or movies you want to watch then I say it is worth it to sign up for at least a month.The  new content is mostly **The Mandalorian** and C**lone Wars - Season 7** with a couple other shows slated for later this year.This is year wandavision falcon and the winter soldier are coming. Go at Disney+\\'s channel at YouTube. There is a video called \"what\\'s coming at 2020\"If you like Marvel IPs, it\\'s worth it.  They have a good chunk of the movies, along with a ton of various cartoon series going back all the way to the 80s.  Some of the recent Marvel live action shows are there or will be showing up.  There are new Marvel shows coming out in the near future.If you like Star Wars IPs, it\\'s worth it.  They have most of the movies along with all the various cartoons.  Mandalorian was great and more live action stuff is coming.If you grew up on Disney cartoons, movies or shows, they have a good chunk of those too which pulls at the nostalgia heartstrings.They are also creating new D+ content.If you like Marvel stuff, or Star Wars stuff, or general Disney stuff, chances are that D+ is going to be worth it for you.It\\'s worth it if you wanna rewatch everything you\\'ve already seen. But other than Mandalorian your won\\'t be missing anything if you don\\'t subscribe right now.  If you are expecting Netflix like content  wait until 2021.Yes. You can even download the whole season.Looks like I\\'m getting it thenCheers guys 👍At once. XdYeah. It will possibly be available few days earlier or the same dayIt should be available the day of the launch, March 24th.Same issue no resolution found just yetDoing the same thing on my miboxSam on my Sony with a fire cube and it just started about 3 weeks ago . I\\'m also getting terrible buffering . Have none of these issues with any app built into the tv or firecube . Hoping maybe someone has solution ?Same here.. does Disney even have a customer support line to complain to? Want some refund back, because we’re are not able to leverage the service that we paid forSame on my Sony XD9305 (Android tv) but happens only when autoplay will start next episode or I press \"play next\" button. If I go back on home and try to play the video manually it will go on until the end without interruptions.Exact same issue here, no solution.Also having this same issue. Haven’t found a resolution yet.I’ve tried Googling and searching this subreddit, but I haven’t had any luck. As the screenshot shows, I only have English and Suomi as options. Any suggestions welcome. Thank you!If there\\'s no subtitles, there\\'s no subtitles. Sorry, mate, but until Disney decides to add them, you won\\'t be able to, except for the new season. That one might have them.Unsupported countries are unlikely to have their language supportedSounds good. Thought maybe it was a bug in my app!I have the same problem on my Sony(x950g) tv\\'s native appSame issue here.  When you initially move to the credits box it highlights but when you click select the highlight goes away and you nothing happens.  The highlighting doesn\\'t return and the credits scene stays minimized.Exact same issue with my fire tv. It seems that many more users have this problem. Hope they fix this bug on the fire tv :(It\\'s to keep you subbed multiple months to the service to finish the shows. If they released it all at once you could binge watch it and cancel after you\\'re done. Of course you can wait until they released all episodes and binge it then.Because the general population who knows Disney but doesn\\'t pay much attention to online stuff don\\'t know much about the shows, so releasing them weekly still works, plus if you release Season 1 all at once those people will expect all seasons to release that way. Do weekly and people know weekly.Releasing them weekly makes far more business sense than dumping all the episodes at once. Its not even subjective it objectively makes more sense for them to do it the way they are doing it.The only evidence of this rumor is this cryptic tweet.  [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DisneyPlusUK/status/1229354731916709888?s=19)There is no confirmed announcement that already released content will be weekly. People may very well be misinterpreting this tweet.I don’t understand this. Everyone who wanted to watch Mando in UK/Europe has already watched it with the Americans.The reasons for this are very obvious.1. delayed release schedules help maintain subscribers as the show releases episodes over multiple months.2. the longer subscription time allows the user to find other things to stay subscribed for, or be a subscriber when something new comes along to hold their interest.3. delayed release schedules also help avoid surges in activity which can overwhelm their system.How well this works is questionable.  People that were going to sub, binge, drop are likely to just delay their sub and do the same thing anyways.  So in reality, option 3 is the only one that might actually apply.They\\'ve already lost a day 1 subscription from me for this. I just knew the UK selection would be stunted. No sign of The Simpsons or Clone Wars. If we have to wait to get new episodes of things until after America instead of at the same time I\\'ll be keeping my eyepatch and parrot on.When they launched in Australia they released the first two episodes (which had already shown in America) on launch day. It\\'s easy to assume they\\'d do the same everywhere else for already released content.I haven\\'t. I wanted to see it high quality where I can leave and come back to it at willI\\'ve been decent at avoiding spoilers thoughWait, what?  No Clone Wars?  I\\'d imagine S1-6 would be on it, as it\\'s currently on DisneyLife, but not having S7 would be monumentally stupid....Wait we don’t Clone Wars in UK with D+? WtfWhy wouldn\\'t TCW be on D+? Of course it\\'s going to be there. Most likely the same as mando with weekly releasesWell they havent mentioned it specifically, but Im at this point thinking we wont get the new season right awayWhat movie is this from?I’ve never known anyone else that knew this cartoon. It was so good and emotional.FFFIIII-GGGAAAAA-RRROOOO!!!Could he beat Monstro in a fight?Yes please! He introduced my sister and I to Opera and while we r at it Laaaaaaabert the Sheepish Lion too!!!!Disney will probably make a live action remakeWow. I smell my childhood in this pic. I full on forgot about this short. It ends kind of tragically doesn’t it?It will probably be added as part of Make Mine Music whenever that gets added to the service.Glad to see so much love for Willie. One of Spirit Animals. (Along with Ferdinand and the Reluctant Dragon)Thatd be great!!What in the world is this?I can hear this pictureMake Mine Music.Make Mine Music. Unfortunately not on Disney plus. :/It was a short cartoon. Honestly one of the best ever made that\\'s why I want to see it saved here.Came for this. Thanks for not disappointing me.To the death? I think Monstro has the upper edge what with being a colossal dog fish.Starring Jack BlackYes and no. I think endings like the one this had are important, especially if it\\'s done as well as this was.Make Mine Music, last segment.Hasn\\'t been released in any format in 20 years IIRC. One of the package films, 1940s.It was released on dvd and laserdisc in some regions, though. Sometimes it\\'s censored., sometimes not (there\\'s a gunfight in one of the segments which I thought was totally unobjectionable, but IIRC this was around when they censored the ET re-release and turned the guns to walkie talkies)Ok, I\\'d totally watch thisI totally agree. Tragedy is a staple in cinema and when it’s presented in an entertaining way we leave feeling satisfied that the story was told. Sympathetic characters are constantly the most relatable.Up until now the content on Disney plus in the netherlands is really disappointing. I hope the official launch will bring some new content.The big question is: will the other European countries lack the same large amount of classic content as the Netherlands?On the 3rd, nothing as the event is on the 5th.All I want to know is what the UK library will look like considering Sky has the rights to most  of the Disney stuff atmWhat are you missing? Like major stuff?Ok so we know it’s a typo. But what do you want to see on the 5th then?Sorry that was a typo fixed now :)We have all the recent blockbusters and more Fox titles than the US. But a LOT of classic Disney stuff is missing:- we only have 10 classic animated shorts- No Mickey’s Christmas Carol- No Flight of the Navigator- No Zorro- No My Dog, The Thief- No The Rescuers (!)- No TaleSpin- No Bonkers- No Emperor’s New School- No Teacher’s Pet series (only the movie)- No Doug series (only the movie)- No Hercules series- No Mickey Mouse Club- No Wonderful World of Disney- No Even Stevens series (only the movie)- No Spin and Marty- Apart from that, a lot of National Geographic shows are unavailableNone of this stuff is currently streaming elsewhere in the Netherlands, so it is unclear why so much is missing. It is slightly worrying as well: the big blockbuster titles will all be added sooner or later. But this library content? Not so sure. I can only hope that there will be a big update when other European markets get Disney+ next month.I would like a sneak peek of The Mandalorian season 2. Monsters At Work preview too.Out of interest what Fox titles do you have? Really struggling to piece together what the UK will get?Why would they do a sneak peek of season two at the European launch event when season one hasn\\'t been released there yet?They\\'re still filming season 2. So how could there be a preview for something that hasn\\'t even been filmed?Simpsons Movie, Mrs. Doubtfire, the Ice Age movies, the Peanuts movie, Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer, Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian, Sound of Music, Journey to the Center of the Earth, Avatar, Anastasia, Thumbelina, Cheaper by the Dozen 1 and 2, Dr. Dolittle 1 and 2, Home Alone 1, 2, and 3, Miracle on 34th Street (1947 and 1994), Never Been Kissed, 5 X-Men films. Plus 30 seasons of the Simpsons. I may have missed some titles, but this covers most of it.The same how all previews works. We got a preview for Loki, WandaVision etc which hasn’t finished filming.Thanks for the comprehensive list! I was hopeful for more \\'grown up\\' drama from Fox like Bones.Disney+ will not offer content with a rating higher than PG-13. For the remainder of the Fox library you’ll have to wait until Disney brings Hulu to Europe.I do t see them winning long term subscribers by limiting their library. They need to challenge the market not be average.At this point I don’t think Disney’s main goal is to come out with more subscribers than Netflix or HBO Max. Their goal is more long-term: a transition in the way they make money off their library. Instead of licensing it to other parties for streaming they want to cut out the middleman and stream it by themselves. They don’t need to make a profit on this for the coming five years, so they are not all that worried if they miss out on some subscribers now. Within 1-3 years I expect them to work on rolling out Hulu in the rest of the world; should that fail they have plenty of time to add an Adults section to Disney+ with the > PG-13 content.Likely a router buffer or firewall error.What I’m thinking is maybe I tunes refunded me for the sub issue and Disney is just now figuring it out, however my issue was already fixed and instead they closed my original account. What has me annoyed is Disney’s refund is not accounted for in my banking records at all, only iTunes.Works pretty well on my Sony x950g, what model do you have?Almost done with the first season and loved every episode so far!Season 2 is top notch. It has a fantastic dark wing duck episode.It\\'s wonderfull! I\\'m watching it with my daughter and the meta-jokes are great.It\\'s honestly perfect. You can tell the folks in charge are fans of the Disney Afternoon. There\\'s so many throwbacks and hints. It really is a wonderful series.Back in November my friends and I binge the entire first 2 seasons in one weekend. We had a blast the entire time.I\\'m not a fan personally. Hate the animation style. You can tell a lot of effort went into it, though.Maybe it needs a system update? Or if it\\'s working fine before, how about a factory reset?I’m having the same problem and I can’t figure anything out. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. Netflix works fine as do other apps, it’s just disney+ that has an issueAny progress with your issue? I was fine on my fire stick 4k up until yesterday. It just would not load. I cleared data/cache, re-install, and now I\\'m stuck in loading screen hell.Disney has no reason to. They make more money keeping R rated content on Hulu and getting customers to pay two subscription feesBrand equity.>they want to keep the app relatively kid friendlyYou answered your own question. Disney+ has a brand. That brand is being family friendly.Why can\\'t we have a family safe service? Netflix does their thing,  HBO does their thing, D+ does their thing. There are plenty of places we have to work like a dog to keep segregated from kids. D+ should not be one of them.That\\'s what Hulu is forBecause they don’t want to. Period. End of story.In the future they will add more adult content. I mean look at all the upcoming Marvel and Star Wars Disney+ originals coming out and then once the HBO deal with Fox ends, I’m sure we’ll end up getting Planet Of The Apes or Alien on the service. And as of now, The Simpson’s is on the service but they can even add more adult cartoons such as Bob’s Burger or Futurama.They make money off hulu?The thing us UK folk don’t get Hulu lolThe X-Men films are on there though and the f bombs are uncensored. The Simpsons are also on there and it has a lot of messed up bloody episodes...Speak for yourself, I signed up for the Marvel and Star wars.Because Disney owns many things that people like. Aliens, predator, all fo the Fox shows. Some of which arent available other than renting them or buying them outright. Hell, even newer movies they own like deadpool arent on there.Also it\\'s not hard to set a Netflix profile to kids only.Hulu would get adult content. Disnely Plus isnt getting Alien.After they purchased Fox they became the majority shareholder in Hulu so yeah, they make money off Hulu.[removed]Yet. Bob Iger has said the international expansion of Hulu starts next yearMarvel and Starwars are safe for kids. Not Deadpool of course.WarnerMedia operates (at a minimum) HBO, HBO Max, Cinemax and DC Universe. Also AT&T TV / Directv NOW. CBS/Viacom operates CBS All Access, Showtime, Pluto TV, Smithsonian Plus, MTV Hits, Comedy Central Now, Nick Hits, etc. Get used to it. These companies deliberately plan to split-off their assets across multiple platforms. Disney has D+, Hulu and ESPN+ at a minimum. D+ wouldn’t cost $7 per month if it was some all-encompassing portal to every Disney-owned property. Instead of forcing everyone to a $20 per month combined platform, they give people the option of buying only what they want.What Disney now owns, and the Disney+ brand are not the same thing. I love Deadpool, but it doesn\\'t fit anywhere in the D+ universe. Just like sports don\\'t fit in just because they own a bunch of sports networks. Branding needs to be consistent, particularly for a family oriented service. Netflix is an anything goes brand. It would be silly for them to suddenly only carry certain kinds of content.Oh dang, didnt know that. Thanks for putting an informative comment unlike the other guyI think at the time of the Fox acquisition, Hulu wasn’t profitable but Disney seems to know how to develop strategies to make flunking assets profitable, and I’m sure they have a strategy in action right now to make it profitable in the future. And like you said, they have a majority stake and full control, so most of the profits (and losses) will go to them.Personally, I\\'d rather them just add disney to hulu. Hulu already has the multiple channels on it. If Disney comes to own hulu then they should just merge it.Deadpool is a part of the marvel universe. Which D+ has...NP though I missed some details honestly. The only other company that owns stock in Hulu at this time is NBCUniversal/Comcast which still owns 33% of Hulu. However, last year they relinquished control of the company meaning that Disney has full control. NBCUniversal is planning to launch a competing service, Peacock, but they can\\'t sell their stake in Hulu until 2024 at which point they\\'ll most likely sell their share back to Hulu leaving it a wholely owned Disney subsidiary.I told you how much they own and that they have the controlling stake. How is that not informative?Hulu reached $1 billion in revenue by 2013, six full years before Disney bought out Fox\\'s 30% stake and before Comcast relinquished their controlThey won’t.This isn’t a situation you can reason your way thru. Disney has made it clear that they do not intend to put Mature or R-rated content on Disney+. If they decide to put something like Once Upon a Deadpool on D+, so be it. There’s no argument you can use to change the situation.And Deadpool is a special case as well as Logan. Neither belong on D+.Wonder if disney will merge the 2 coming 2024That was 7 years ago and is too outdated for today. A more recent article says they lost as much as $440 million during Q3 2018, $207 million loss a year before then, and a $357 million loss in Q2 2018. When discussing economics/finance, you have to keep in mind that it’s always changing and what happened to a company 7 years ago is probably not the same today.https://www.google.com/amp/s/variety.com/2019/digital/news/hulu-25-million-subscribers-2018-ad-revenue-1203102356/amp/Guess not, should really learn that companies will never make senseBut the Simpsons does? A show that has many crude violent episodes?Doubtful. Disney likes their family image so I imagine they\\'ll continue to maintain Disney+ as their family friendly arm while continuing to use Hulu as it\\'s source for less family oriented programming. Plus, they make more money keeping the services separate. Same reason they haven\\'t added their ESPN content to either of the other services.No they wont. They have zero reason toFollow the $$$. Again, there are a lot of benefits to splitting the content across multiple platforms. $7 per month for Disney+ seems like a great bargain to many families who just want that content. And another $12 isn’t a huge price to pay if you want the entire Hulu library including more mature Disney/Fox content and even the ESPN+ bundle. Hulu and D+ each have about 30 million subscribers. I can guarantee you a single combined service that charges $20 per month for all of that content would not have 30 million subs. There’s strength in the ability to buy just what you want.The Simpsons vs Deadpool.  I\\'ve watched a lot of the Simpsons. I don\\'t think I can go there.Sounds about right I guess. Hopefully when they gain full control they put everything they own that doesnt make disney plus onto huluOh no you misunderstood my last comment. I meant how Hulu has stars but you cant access the content without paying more. Just do that but with Disney plus. So you can access it in hulu but you have to pay the extra fee for disney.Togo. Watched it last night. Really good! A lot better than I thought it was going to be. Willam Defoe is great. Definitely perfect to sit down and watch with the family.Gravity FallsI just wrapped up the first season of Bluey, so I can be ready for the second season coming out next month - hopefully they add that one, too.Even though I also have Hulu, I\\'m watching season 3 of Marvel\\'s Runaways on Disney+ for the simple fact that I won\\'t get slowed down or sidetracked by commercials.If you haven\\'t watched I\\'d definitely suggest Avengers: Earth\\'s Mightiest Heroes and Wolverine and the X-Men.Just finished up Rapunzel\\'s Tangled Adventures season 2 and loving the tackling of some dark themes like abuse, abandonment, and ptsd/trauma. Not to mention beautiful art with wondrous songs to boot.MCU rewatch.Can\\'t wait for Falcon and the Winter Solider!For Star Wars Fans I’d recommend The Mandalorian which wrapped up its season in December and the final season of Star War the Clone Wars for new and old fans of the show which debuted its first episode Friday. For movies I’d recommend Togo and the live action remake of Lady and the Tramp. They were both really good watches and overall great movies. If you like the live action remakes you’ll love Lady and the Tramp. If you like movies based on true stories, then you’ll love Togo. Plus, the acting is great. For Pixar fans, the Sparkshorts are always a treat giving light to new creative people at Pixar. I’d also recommend Forky asks a question short and the short lamp life as it gives more life and story to the toy story franchise, and explains what happened to no all these years as well.I just finished watching Star vs. The Forces of Evil. Holy Mickey that\\'s one of the best original cartoons Disney has put out in a LOOOOONG timeMandalorian was great.I\\'ve watched all the Marvel cartoon content (except the various xmen series which is next on the agenda).  Anything pre 2010 is pretty bad.  Stuff after 2010 is decent for the most part but your mileage may vary a bit with some of the oddball stuff (agents of smash for instance).Togo was excellent.The various shorts are pretty good, although the collections of shorts based on any of the cartoon shows are skippable as most of them are just one of the episodes cut into chunks.If you like classic Disney animation, check out Adventures of the Gummi Bears, DuckTales, and Darkwing Duck.  I’m going through all of them right now and it’s a nostalgic trip.  The writing in DWD is so puny.  I love it.I watched Toy Story 4 last night.  I\\'m just gonna say it; Bo is a B.The Simpsons. I recommend Jump In as it destroys stereotypes (a guy competing in a double Dutch competition where he is raised to believe that he has to follow in his dad’s footsteps) and double Dutch is a girly thing, which is not,  since any gender of any age can do double Dutch. All in all, it’s a fun movie and I love it.Curious why some shows are missing from the kids profile?  Example, Cars and Cars 2 show up on my kids profile but Cars 3 does not.  It\\'s rated G, so I couldn\\'t imagine it would be considered an adult show.  I have to switch over to my main profile to get Cars 3 to show up.  &#x200B;Just curious - thanks!Soy luna season 2 and 3Anyone else on ps4 having issues with audio changing languages and being unable to move onto the next episode with ease?Lilo and stitch (the tv show) I grew up on it and now I get to relive the enjoyment I had. I used to wake up early to watch it before school.Star Wars The Clone Wars and The Mandalorian.Watching **Future Avengers**. It\\'s legit great. Haven\\'t seen a new Marvel cartoon series I liked this much since Hulk and the Agents of SmashI’d recommend watching the first new episode of the new clone wars season if your into sci fi stuff but if not and your into more lifestyle drama I’d recommend watching diary of a future president as it actually undertakes and goes through the early age life of a future president while it’s described through her diary.Ngl. A movie hasn’t made me cry in a long time. But the scene at the end where >!Togo hobbles out of the house to Seppala after he’s officially retired!< made me tear up.Such a good show.  Would love to see more seasons as a D+ exclusive.Wolverine and the X-Men feels like all the best parts of the original tv cartoon series but updated and improved upon in all the right ways.I second Wolverine and the X-men, really good show.That show is such a gem I wish more people knew about it. Season 3 is fantastic so far!Been doing this as well. Trying to finish before Black Widow comes out in May.>Anything pre 2010 is pretty badDude, the original X-men cartoon from the 90s is fantastic. Different strokes, though, I imagine I\\'m a few years older than you.>your mileage may vary a bit with some of the oddball stuff (agents of smash for instance).Agents of Smash is great.>The various shorts are pretty goodI would rather get a root canal than watch any of Marvel Rising.Yeah, Darkwing Duck manages to hold up the best of any of the Disney Afternoon. Well, except Gargoyles, which had outrageously good production values.X-men is an exception.  That was a great show.  But if you watch any of the old spiderman, fantastic 4, etc...it\\'s painful.I like agents of smash, but it\\'s format and humor can be offputting.The shorts, the actual short films.  Not the marvel cartoon shorts.  Those tend to be split up episodes and they are annoying.So yeah, I agreeI still watch the House of Villains special every Halloween. Great show; hope it can make the move to D+ soon.I requested this on Disney+’s requests feedback. Great show. I hope Mickey’s House of Villains is on the service in time for Halloween 2020!House of Mouse + MouseWorks! Let\\'s make it Happen!!Honest question: Why is it this subreddit is allowed all these threads about shows/movies not on D+, but when I made a post informing about a missing holiday special for a series that IS on the service, the thread got deleted almost immediately and I was sent a message by the moderation directing me toward a discussion thread that had been dead for months (in which no one mentioned said special)?It’s a streaming service, meaning the entire library isn’t available on Day 1. It will be up eventually. No real need to be upset.I\\'m surprised that that\\'s not there, it was removed from Netflix sometime ago and it\\'s not on disney+ yetHouse of Mouse has something special the originals do not, They have all the Disney Characters interact with each other with Mickey as the Host! Man I wish they would make a working Replica at Hollywood Studios. For Reference its like when Robot Chicken made that Nintendo Direct video with Nintendo Characters backstage.You’re explaining a show I know about... I’mNot saying it’s not a good show or anything.No no, my good lad, I explaining you a show I don’t know about...I see..not sure why you’re doing that but ok.I want a healthy mix of both. Disney has a deep catalog but the average viewer demands fresh content.originalI think almost everything I want has been added to the service so far (save a handful of TV shows that I’m pretty sure they’re going to release at some point. I’d love to see Fillmore!, W.I.T.C.H. and American Dragon: Jake Long. I know at least The Weekenders is showing up soon) but I didn’t expect to enjoy the originals as much as I have. They definitely surprised me and I’d love to see more original programming :).Restored, as the near majority of Disney content is not yet available for purchase or stream. Looking at you, Pepper Ann!More restored old content. Classic Black and White Disney shorts need to be restored with correct titles and most theatrical era shorts haven\\'t been released since Disney Treasures.restored for now. eventually they can pretty much have most of it on and then they can turn their attention fully to originalI’d love more rebooted series like the new Lizzie McGuire show.I was original.I was stoked when a Oswald series was announced a year or so ago, and continue to love original things I watch.What id love is all the old time shorts being on D+ and being able to have them auto play/organized into collectionsYou can see a large list of Disney produced content on Wiki. I\\'d love a more deep archive of old shows etcRestoredOriginalAt some point, logically, Disney will have diminishing returns on content to restore, so more \"Originals\". But I\\'d rather they just make great content, no necessarily content for a specific platform.My idea for a original D+ series is an updated version of House Of Mouse with the properties that Disney bought over the years like Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and the Simpsons.Original!!!Well yeah, just what would you specialty want more?I mostly want the classic movies and TV series pre 1990s. Stuff like Zorro and Walt Disney\\'s Wonderful World of Color.Ah yes, most I know is the sing-along song from the owl classroom bitI\\'m the that could watch old content all day. The only reason I subscribe still to the WWE Network is because of their past content. It\\'s new to meIts not working for me on my laptop browser. Works fine in the TV and phone apps though.Have you tried disabling your ad blocker?What type of browser do you use?Have you tried logging in on the Disney+ application? If that didn’t work, try to clear your browser’s cache and try it one more time.I have experienced an issue about logging in. It redirects me to login again even after I entered my email and password. If you have experienced this as well and this is the issue that you are having, might as well, perform the work around procedure mentioned above. I hope you got to work it this time.yeah it just keep spinningFirefox. I tried on edge and chrome still no luckJohn Henry is on disney+ at one of their short films bundled along with other short filmsJohnny Apple Seed should be part of Melody Time as that\\'s where it originatedJohnny Appleseed was originally a segment of 1948\\'s Melody Time which is on Disney+.Or the Wonderful World of Disney shows. I wouldn\\'t mind seeing that stuff on Disney+Johnny Appleseed is from Melody Time, which is on Disney+.Adventures in Wonderland is also MIAI was just telling my wife that 8nwas disappointed in the lack of classic disney materialI was hoping for shows I\\'ve heard about but never seen, like king henry VIII, or the entire original mickey mouse clubMore importantly how is Donald Duck in Mathmagic Land not on Disney+??The movie Tall Tale is on Disney +. I know it\\'s not what you want but from what I remember as a kid it was cool.... I dont know how it\\'s agedLet\\'s not forget MarsupilamiAnd where is Laaaaaambert!Did we go to the same school?Good pointThat Paul Bunyan cartoon is one of my all-time favorites...I managed to find it on YouTube but the audio is about 3 seconds out of sync. To this day I\\'ll still whistle or hum or sing little bit of the song...\"Heyyy, Paauul! Paauul Bunyan...\"*John Henry* is on the *Walt Disney Animation Studios Short Films Collection*, which is currently tied up on Netflix.I remember watching the combo DVD with those three and KC Jones, practically on repeat as a kid. Those films are the best. John Henry still gets me every timeYooo we still have this dvdBut it is on Disney+I absolutely forgot about these until I saw this post. I did indeed watch them back in Elementary school and would love to see it on the service.My boy John Henry!!Uh oh, Disney is gonna get you for this. They hate it if you ask about stuff that\\'s not on Disney plus. I mentioned  Rogers and Hammerstein\\'s Cinderella and they took it down.Because PCBecause kids prefer trash like Frozen.Whats strange is i keep coming across references to john henry lately. Showed up on a torrent site as well as an ad for a new terry crews video and then multiple times on reddit for the animated one. Popular topic currentlyIt totally is.Although this does once again bring up the question: Why isn\\'t Make Mine Music on here?This is the most disappointing thing about Disney+ in my opinion. For some reason you also can\\'t find the shows anywhere online either (that I know of)I want to watch the tv series of Aladdin and Tarzan just to see how terrible they were. I used to wake up early before school to watch them all the time.I agree! My kids deserve a chance to watch that show and be terrified, just like I was.The first Oz movie also appears to be missing while its sequel is available to watch. Either that or I’m just an idiot.God damn I went on a set tour of that show when I was a kid. Would love to see it again.[deleted]Asking the real questions. I immediately looked for Lambert Day 1. And the crazy thing is I’m pretty sure it used to be on Netflix as one of those cartoon collection things. But it looks like they don’t have it anymore so I don’t know what the hold up is.It was easier than teaching...That was one of my favorites. I didn’t even think to look for it on there.No worries, I watch on my iPad.Wife and I watch on XboxSince when were any of these not PC?You are not a clown. You are the entire circus.I honestly don\\'t know, I asked D+ customer service and they said that they don\\'t have plans to add it there. I would love to know the same thing, as well. It\\'s my favorite of the \"package films\" and never has been released fully unedited on home video.I imagine underground networks of people with stacks of VHS tapes dealing in TV shows.There are *some* WWoD movies on there, just not all of them. I have a feeling we\\'ll get to see more and more though.The Hercules one wasn\\'t too bad.I don’t remember it being scary. I do remember the theme song...The Wizard of Oz, and Return to Oz?MGM owns Wizard of Oz film. Disney licensed the Ruby Slippers from MGM for the Return to Oz.YesIt was probably to go along with the Tall Tales unit like it did at my school. My dad did this a few weeks ago with his class.Works on my Android tooIn this context, PC means politically correct.Johnny appleseed talks about prayer and God and the Bible in a positive manner.  Definitely not PCHa, I wouldn’t trust that there’s no plans. I did support for D+ for a month (my team was brought  on to support the normal team over the holidays) and we were never told about upcoming releases. In fact, we were told to say that there’s additional content added at intervals and to have people suggest tiles on the website. I once had someone on chat send me a list of about 60 titles they wanted added and that’s what I told them. But they’ll probably never show the unedited version with “The Matins and the Coys” included. Because life is sad and the segment shows hillbillies with guns.I love it too, and I can\\'t think of anything objectionable that would make them wary of including it. An answer like that from Disney makes me worry they\\'ve lost the original print or something.If people are like that with Neo-Geo games there has to be secret briefcase sales of rare Disney content too.Are there others other than the Disneyland seasons one?My guess is the reason that isn\\'t there is the same reason so many others aren\\'t and that\\'s simply because they\\'ve never streamed anywhere yet and getting them to the streaming service for the first time takes a heck of a lot of work I think behind the scenes but I suppose within 10 years most of these gems should finally be thereIt wasn\\'t scary per se, just that a few of those characters (i.e. the caterpillar, the Cheshire cat, and the white rabbit) looked terrifying to a young me> MGM owns Wizard of Oz film.Yep, that\\'s the one I think. Guess the rights explain why it\\'s missing.[deleted]How deluded are you? Not only is there nothing un-PC about Johnny Appleseed, it\\'s also ON DISNEY+ ALREADY, so you really have no leg to stand on here.I hope you\\'re jokingKeep in mind the support for D+ is not, to my knowledge, actual Cast Members. My understanding is they may be agents from a company called Arise, who does support for multiple companies. I very highly doubt that support agent really knows if there’s plans to release it or not. I’d like them to add it, but for now my DVD copy will do.There sure are! ZMy Dog the Thiefz is on there, and it\\'s exactly the kind of old school Disney movie that I was hoping for! I don\\'t know how many others, but I know there are more. I\\'m not really sure which movies were theatrical and which were from Magical/Wonderful World, but there\\'s one in particular I\\'ve been looking for since like 1998. A family goes to creepy hotel on the coast to become caretakers, I think. I think it\\'s B&W, but I don\\'t really remember because I was touring with a punk rock band back then and my memory....well you know.Sadly, I\\'m not.  I think Walt would be rolling in his grave to see what his company and american culture has chosen to honor and dishonorThe good news is, whether Disney is now zombified enough to *actually* roll in his grave or not, he can rest easy. Johnny appleseed is in fact on disney +. Look for Melody Time!...?Maybe factory resetting your AppleTV will work?I was also having an issue while watching a movie last night. Anytime I tried to rewind it stopped playing and giving me the “OH No” screen. Tried all you did but the restart didn’t fix the issue.  However went to another show and had no issues.  Chocked it up to an issue with that movie.  Will monitor and maybe do a factory reset if it does it again.  I also verified network (it’s on Ethernet not WiFi).The past two days it’s been doing the same to me as well. The app just closes as I go to play any movie available. I was hoping there would be a reason or permanent solution here but I guess not.I am seeing something similar on my Roku Ultra. Pretty much need to reboot the box every time I want to watch an episode of Star Wars Rebels. Have not tried any other shows yet. It has been doing this for 2-3 days.Oof so extreme tho! So many reinstalls and logins etcHopefully an update fixes it!I don\\'t think we\\'ll get a hub for Blue Sky because it isn\\'t a big enough brand to do so.I do think we\\'ll get some of them in 4k, but it\\'ll more than likely be the newer ones for now, unless Disney/20th remaster the old ones.Doubt to Blue Sky getting anything more than a collection at best. However, I am still hoping for a full 20th Century banner eventually. It\\'s larger than both Marvel and Star Wars combined. I think it definitely deserves it\\'s own hub.In Australia The only ice age in 4K is collision courseprobably not, but we\\'ll probably get a collection page for them  and i don\\'t think Ice Age has a 4K remaster out so it will most likely be HD only.[deleted]Considering only the most recent Ice Age movie has a 4K release, I doubt we will see the older ones released in a version besides the original HD.I doubt that Blue Sky Studios will ever get it\\'s own hub, but I think it\\'ll have a section in the eventual 20th Century Studios hub. Blue Sky Studios should also get a collection under the Search tab, as well as an individual Ice Age collection. They got two individual collections for Toy Story and Forky Asks a Question so why not.That seems like the best way to represent Blue Sky Studios to me.EDIT: Although, there *is* [the Blue Sky Studios logo above The Peanuts Movie logo](https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/f781ux/the_peanuts_movie_is_now_available_on_disney_in/), and they only really put logos above the logos for movies and series for brands that have their own hub, so that could indeed point to Blue Sky Studios getting it\\'s own separate hub. Interesting!I think we\\'ll get a 20th Century Studios banner after 2022. Fox has most of its films in a contract with HBO that expires in 2022. As of now, there\\'s only about a few Fox movies on Disney+Do you have all the ice age films in Australia?YepIn Canada I have noticed there are two full versions of some star wars movies. One is french the other is English. The opening crawl was all french but I don\\'t think the dialogue was. It was odd.Some say changing your default language to English(UK) in your profile settings resolves the problem. Don\\'t forget to restart the show not resume. There\\'s also a work around, instead of searching for the movie title in the search bar, you should select the Star Wars category from the home page then select the movie again from the Star wars menu. There\\'s a chance that it will do the trick.Me too! Little mermaid was always on before kindergartenYes! Indeed.Now, I want the Aladdin tv series :)SameIt’s going on the 4K disc apparently.I don’t know why it isn’t on there anymore.I missed this, what was it?It was removed literally days after it arrived. Almost like a mistake.I was looking for this yesterday too. I dig around on google and according to tons of articles it was in the extras at some point but it’s definitely gone nowJust checked my purchased copy on Vudu and it\\'s gone from there, too. I am disappoint.I never knew this was on D+, I thought this was always a Movies Anywhere exclusive.Was it not on the previous 4K disc? I much prefer the old boxart to the new one.TLJ, but the sound is removed and the score is amplifiedJeez, so you had it with your Extras and now it\\'s gone? I guess they\\'re pushing the new 4K disc really hard...Even if it was... it’s not there now. I’ve been digging through my extras for this movie today. Def not on MA.It was part of the Digital Copy Extras that came with the last 4K disc.It wasn’t. Only as a digital exclusive.Is it good?It\\'s still in my iTunes copy.My Digital Copy code was redeemed through iTunes and synced with Movies Anywhere.I still see it on MA here, it\\'s the only thing under the Music & More headingBut it came with the digital copy from the 4K Collector\\'s Edition, right? Now some are making it sound like it\\'s not even *there* anymore...It’s a really cool experience, but I prefer it with sound for obvious reasonsI mean, at least you don\\'t have to listen to the inane plot that Ruin Johnson crapped out.Thank you, I didn’t think to check my other MA connected listenings, it was still under extras there. Huzzah!For anyone else looking; Linking accounts under Movies Anywhere was what unlocked the score-only track originally, if it’s gone on one platform it’s worth checking other ones linked through MA.Thanks! I don’t know how I missed it before? So weird.Right, but it was never on the disc proper. Now it seems Disney is changing that with the 4K disc release.You mean the plot that wasnt what you exactly wanted it to be lmfaoRight, I getcha. I\\'d be content just having access to the digital copy of it.No, I mean one that was awful regardless of fan expectations. Not everyone that hated that rubbish jad some head canon they wanted it to live up to. It was just a bad film.Did you try 0800 instead?   I got that idea from [this](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toll-free_telephone_number) Wikipedia article (see ‘Around the World Section’).Traditionally in the USA 1800 numbers are toll free.  Historically a 1800 number in the USA could only be dialed from within the USA.It\\'s best to contact them through chat.The number you typed is one number too short. Is that the number you’re trying? American numbers are 7 digits after a 1800, you only typed 6.Tried it, still nothing.Their response time in 1 message per every two minutes. So bad lol.It\\'s listed on their website, I copy and pasted it.I can’t find numbers that I think will help you from New Zealand.  Googling from your region will of course produce regional results.   I did find this email address that might be helpful DisneyPlusHelp@disney.comLol. You got that right. But at least it\\'s easier to reach them through chat than giving them a call.They won\\'t, that\\'s what hulu and such is for. They started Touchstone pictures just for more adult fare.Deadpool 100%They shouldn\\'t.I’d much prefer they do a big dump of all content.Not having mature content is such a stupid and frustrating decision.DeadpoolDeadpool 2LoganSome horror movies like Alien and Predator 💙ABC/FX/Fox/hulu series (someones is not Mature but not in D+) like Revenge, 24, Grey\\'s Anatomy, Legion, The Gifted, Amarican Horror StoryNew seasons of R Marvel series like Daredevil, Punisher, Jessica Jones...could add a premium service with adult content called \"hulu on Disney +\"Pulp Fiction. Vincent Vega: Marvin, what do you make of all of this?Marvin: Man, I don\\'t even have an opinion.::gunshot::Vincent Vega: Ah man I just shot Marvin in the face.Hence why he said IF...And also Logan of course>could add a premium service with adult content called \"hulu on Disney +\"So basically Hulu.If my aunt had balls then she would be my uncle. Disney plus isn’t adding rated R movies. It’s a pointless post.hulu is only US.I don’t understand why every time it’s necessary to say the limitation of hulu, the whole world is without the service, I just gave an idea of unifying in other territories.Hulu is also available in Japan.Hulu is going to be expanded internationally soon. They have to work out the streaming rights first.would be easier to have one service though1. Not every 4:3 show was cropped for widescreen. But the ones that are (The Simpsons) still haven\\'t been fixed yet. 2. No commentaries for The Simpsons3. Not every animated series is on Disney+. Aladdin is not4. Love Stuck looks to be episode 20 of Bonkers on Disney+. So guessing no?Bonkers has not been released in the Netherlands so far, so it’s not a given that you will get it in the UK at launch.I\\'m in US, offerings may vary in your region.1. Depends. Most of the disney afternoon stuff is proper OAR, pre-20 Simpsons aren\\'t, it\\'s kind of all over the place. A lot of other stuff is P&S or related, mostly animated films plus some direct to video stuff from the late 80s, 90s and early 00s.2. No.3. No Aladdin :\\'( but - much of the rest of the Disney Afternoon and such is - **Gargoyles**, **Timon & Pumba**, **Little Mermaid**, **Talespin**, Original **Ducktales**, **Darkwing Duck** mostly in original aspect ratio. Also, tons of 90s and 00s Marvel superhero cartoons like **X-men**, Wolverine & the X-men, Hulk and the Agents of Smash, etc. If you like 90s and 00s cartoons, you\\'re going to like it. A lot.4.  Bonkers is on there. First episode is \"In the Bag\"The UK isn’t getting the Simpsons at all. At least at launch.UK doesn’t get Simpson’s lolOK, so why remove Simpsons from FX if they won\\'t even port over the commentaries? That was kind of the whole point of watching them online. Plus it costs WAY more to buy Seasons 1-19 on DVD.Edit: I checked and it costs £200 on Amazon. Seasons after 19 don\\'t have Commentaries.What. :/ But there\\'s nowhere else to even watch it! It didn\\'t get a DVD release or anything!I guess that makes it easier for me.So which shows is the UK getting?They do thoughSome of the Dis+ stuff has commentaries/special features, esp the newer Marvel stuff. Just not the Simpsons.The point of them being on a streaming service was to increase revenue, which was a priority before consumer satisfaction regarding commentaries. FX is a rival streaming service to D+, which is why it was removed from there, and there is no requirement for D+ to add the commentaries. If it’s really that big of a deal, I would contact support, but keep in mind there’s about 3 or 4 movies on the entire service with commentary tracks.True, it is really disappointing. The US got it, Canada too I think. We did not, for unknown reasons.God knows. I’m guessing we will get another Netflix shafting for a few yearsUK Disney + won’tI just feel like DVD extras should be on streaming services, or they\\'re not worth putting on there. Sometimes what I do is buy the DVDs and watch the higher quality versions of shows that are on streaming services, so I still get the extra content, but it costs so much I would rather just watch the LQ DVD versions of shows because DVDs are a one-timer purchase.Though a lot of shows on Disney + don\\'t have commentaries or were even on DVD in the first place.Maybe English speaking countries get it or something.They areDisney+ is far ahead of most other streaming services with DVD/Blu-ray bonus features. Most streaming services in the US (Netflix, Amazon, etc) have zero bonus features for anything, but many of D+’s theatrical movies have at least a few deleted scenes from the Blu-rays. The newer films (2019 Dumbo and newer) seem to have most, of not all, of their traditional home entertainment extras, based on what I’ve read on this sub and I can confirm Toy Story 4 is missing 5 extras (not including trailers) out of 28 made if I counted correctly.Could be... but more classic content was never made available in the Netherlands, including stuff for which subtitles and dubs exist. I think they either left it out because small markets are less important or maybe because of EU quota. We’ll know more when other European markets get Disney+ in March.Sky has the rights for it though 🤷🏻\\u200d♂\\u200dOK, but I care more about the history of animation, so I\\'d rather have features on older content.Anyway, do you know why the Netherlands got Disney+ before the rest of Europe?D+ is still better than most other US streaming services for that, even if they don’t have close to everything. Most streaming services have zero bonus features for both new and old content.Yes, to beta test it. Internet connections are very good here on the whole and there are a lot of Netflix subscribers (so the concept of streaming needed no introduction here). Besides, the Netherlands is a small market so if something would have gone wrong it wouldn’t immediately have attracted a lot of global media attention and caused PR issues for Disney.I guess so, not like I can watch anything on Disney+ now.Shows up fine for me, maybe a glitch.Weird, it\\'s still not showing for me. (web browser, list of movies from A to Z)Did you try searching for it?Searching for it does work, but when I look at the A-Z list, I only find Dumbo (2019).This is awesome, really hope it’s a Darth Vader movieDillard and Owens are both terrible.They\\'re doing weekly releases for the UK, even on shows that have already finished airing in the US (The Mandalorian). I think it\\'s kind of ridiculous since the first season has been finished for months[removed][deleted]Hello Everyone! I am marking this thread as the MegaThread/Episode Discussion thread for Clone Wars S7 E1. Please kindly remember to mark/hide spoilers!Thanks.(Fixed typo...please send coffee. )This is where the fun beginsEpisode is really good! Wish the whole season dropped today. I really hate waiting week after week. 😫I don’t see it just yet on my endWait..how many episodes is this going to be?Awesome episode. I didn’t rewatch a lot of the old episodes before this but I don’t remember the camera moving so dynamically. Animation in general is obviously a lot better (the lighting was really impressive) but I was surprised by the action and the way it was directed.I can\\'t wait to watch season 7 episode 1!It’s also in Dolby vision !!!“You coulda had a bad batch!” - Lazzo[removed]*cries in Germany*I thought the homage to Tartakovsky\\'s Clone Wars was a nice touch, with the lone LAAT gunship carrying the commando team and flying through a canyon getting spotted by battle droids and then shot down. The sideways skid along the ground was a nice touchGod its good.This would be a lot more thrilling if I didn’t already know how this was gonna end.How good is the \"20 essential episodes\" playlist on Disney+? Is it much better to just watch the whole series ?How many episodes for s7?I was hoping for 4K.I dont have access to this atm, is in 4k?I was really suprised they used that unused episode. :DIt’s a little disappointing that the first story arc is one we’ve already seen (in unfinished animatic form) but I’m definitely excited as hell for this.I prefer Disney\\'s approach.  It keeps shows relevant longer.  We\\'ll be talking about new Clone Wars episodes for 3 months rather than 1 day...It allows for discussion. Season drops on one day don’t really allow for thoughtful discussion as the series progresses.Netflix and other streaming services have spoiled us with dropping an entire season all at once. While frustrating, I enjoy one episode at a time, especially with cliffhangers. Let\\'s the anticipation and questions build up waiting to see what happens next.Yeah, I would binge it so badly!I\\'m kind of excited to watch week to week. It will force me to really get into each episode. I was a binger with all previous seasons. As much as I liked the show, I never really felt like I was *super* into it because often times with animation I lose my focus easily and I often find myself doing other things while the show would be on. Now I think I\\'ll appreciate each individual episode far more. My only real wish was that this season let the episodes be longer than 22 minutes. I understand they wanted to keep it that way in case of syndication, but really who is going to be airing these things when they\\'re on Disney+ from here on out? They could have had some more freedom. I fear certain episodes (at the start of arcs) will just feel like a tease week to week.Clone Wars lends itself very well to binge watching. This is one I wish they dropped all at once as they are short episodes to begin with.Damn, I assumed they would drop it all at onceClose and reopen the app, right now it still says coming February 21st despite it being available12 total including this, each four episodes are a single story arc.Yeah there were some gorgeous long takes in battle scenes etcEverything felt more visceral and real on this episodeThe first episode is amazingHow do I get it show me Dolby? Like what device do I need?It was Dolby Vision on the built on LG app and on the Apple TV 4k. However the 2019 Nvidia Shield didn\\'t offer Dolby Vision, which is odd. None of the platforms have it in Atmos which is too bad.And Vizio TV\\'s just got the Disney app. Now we can watch all content that\\'s in Dolby Vision😂[removed]Yes!First episode was perfectYes!! Sadly :(Depends, I watched the entire 6 seasons and they were amazing! If you don’t have time and you want to rush through it do the 20 episodes12I think it has DolbyIt\\'s in 4k with Dolby Vision.It doesn\\'t display so until you go down and click on season 7.Yes w DVIt’s your own fault for watching that alreadyand people will have to keep their subscription for 3 monthsAgreed. Mandalorian did this well, too.I really wish episodes were twice a week. That first week of The Mandalorian where the first episode dropped Tuesday and the second one dropped Friday that was the perfect amount of time to wait[deleted]Uhh speak for yourself, I talk about Clone Wars almost weekly with my peers. As for this approach, I personally find it annoyingI think the writing is improved with week to week shows.  Season drops allow for sloppy writing in the middle chunk of episodes because \\'eventually\\' it\\'ll get good again.  Whereas weekly shows have to remain consistently good week to week to keep your viewership.ok! I am still catching up using the ultimate order someone posted awhile back, i am working through season 2! Can\\'t wait!Do we know what the other two story arcs are about? One of them is a big battle that we skipped right?I just have a 4k oled and it showed me Dolby on my Sony what tv u have ?Shield doesn’t offer Dolby only the new shield 2020 version doesAnd people complain if certain shows that they like are cancelled or are of poor quality. If you like something, support it. You can say Disney makes enough money. But each of those shows have writers, animators, and investors who put their time, effort, and money to get it where it is.Thanks. Kind of odd number.Ahh HDR?Right. It’s his fault that he wanted more Clone Wars content because we were told we wouldn’t get any more, and he’s not allowed to be mildly disappointed that now that we are getting new content, the first arc is recycled.What an idiot he is.You\\'re right. I should travel back in time five years and warn everyone not to watch the second half of the Story Reel releases.Or people will wait 3 months and then binge itFrom a certain viewpoint, that\\'s a good thing.The benefit of streaming is you never miss an episode, and after a season ends you can binge whenever you want.  I get that people have issues with the week to week format because of Netflix, but IMO, a weekly show on streaming is the best of both worlds for viewers.  Those who want a week to week and those who want to binge.  It’s all available.Wait... There\\'s an ultimate order to watching Clone Wars?Would I be able to pester you for the link?After Bad Batch it is Ahsoka\\'s Walkabout, basically her on Coruscant after leaving the order. She meets twins. The last one is Siege of Mandalore.I have a Samsung I don’t which oneWish it was more :(Idk 😐Or people will wait three months and put on their peglegs and eyepatchesThat’s what I’ll do! I haven’t even seen Mandalorian. May is gonna be lit!yep, i was thinking of cancelling disney plus for a small while so I can afford a month of HBO in May but I dont wanna miss out on anything. I already have 4 streaming services going on right now.[Not sure if same list as ops but this is the chronological list via the official Star Wars website. 😀](https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-the-clone-wars-chronological-episodeorder)https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/35ex94/the_clone_wars_ultimate_episode_order/Thank you!Awesome, it even has the novels listed, thank you so much!You might want to contact Disney.RIP. Another great show not on.I will surely submit both of those in my request sorry thank you.On Disney+ theres a place to submit feedback for content. I requested this a couple weeks ago. My kids love Toy Story / Buzz and I\\'d love more shorter episode style stuff for them to watch. This would be perfect. Anyway hopefully if enough ppl request it, maybe we\\'ll get it.I also requested The Toy Story Time Forgot and Toy Story of Terror.It was exactly the same as it was 5 years ago, only now the animation is finished. (Lucasfilm released 8 of the unfinished S07 episodes back in 2014-2015 on starwars.com)I had no clue that even existed :oYep, and you can watch all 8 here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBd_BgIiG59MyRGbnDYNRiQSince Crystal Crisis on Utapau is unlikely to be released in finished form, that\\'s an arc to watch.The Bad Batch is obviously the beginning of Season 7, and \"Ahsoka and Nyx\" has been finished with modifications for this season.Makes sense, most of their originals are 4K Dolby Vision. Probably just the new season though.It played in DV on my Apple TV. Looked great, but wish it had AtmosSeason 7 is, yes. The old seasons are not.Yep. Season 7 is full 4K/HDR. Pretty cool!No mention of 4K or Dolby Vision on my Roku TVYup it is, not a glitch.Just came in time for the vizio app releaseMine doesn’t say that.It literally says HD right next to your circleNot all. The World According to Jeff Goldblum and The Imagineering Story are both only HD SDR. But yeah, most originals are 4K Dolby Vision.That’s only for my iPhone. I know it only plays an HD on my device. What I’m trying to say is I’m guessing that season 7 is 4K on other 4K devices like Apple TV 4K. Or could be a glitchThe first season has not finished. Current seasons do not appear on Disney+, but if you are a cable subscriber with Disney Jr, you can access them on the DisneyNow app. Once the season finishes (Mid-March according to Wiki), it will eventually come to Disney+ (shows have arrived 1-3 months after the season ends).>\\tMy daughter loves TOTS, it’s a Disney show airing on Disney junior, why is it not on the app?Because it\\'s on Disney Junior.It\\'s not very profitable to show the same content on (competing) platforms.Production company(s)\\tTitmouse, Inc.Just like Netflix, current shows don’t show up on streaming until later.They got a Disney junior section on D+, apparently it’s bc the first season is still ongoing (from another answer) so hopefully later this year we’ll see it. My kids love this too, it’s the last of the Disney junior shows I’d like to add to my watch listYep. Just came here to see if anybody else had this. Tangled is where I noticed it.you\\'re not alone. I\\'m also getting the odd French text while watching Star Wars..in my case, the Clone Wars movie. Definitely a few kinks to be worked out.I just got through the Disney+chat help. What a joke. The guy told me that Canada\\'s primary language is french and the movies are put out in that country\\'s primary language. I told him he\\'s an idiot so i got hung up on.This is also happening with me. We are in Ontario so this must be a Canadian issue. Hopefully they get this figured out quick. I went to call customer service line about it but they told me my wait would be upwards of 2 hours so I hung up and now I’m just hoping they fix this.I had this issue yesterday when viewing it from my Watchlist.  Checked this morning and tried it again on my Apple TV 4K.  It’s all fixed for me and playing in 4K.  I played the movie by going to the Star Wars section off the main page of the app instead of Watchlist.  Not sure if this makes a difference for anyone else.Try to change the language of your profile between English (US) and English (UK). It helped for me, but my TV and browser are set to French, so it might not work for you.Honestly it would not surprise me if its somehow a region related bug...because canada...Quebec...computer assumes frenchI am trying to deal with this. I requested a live chat with support. It said 30 min wait time. I have been waiting for over an hour. I will keep the sub posted if they give me an answer ... if they get to me that isJust finished Monsters Inc and noticed it there. I\\'m about to start Monsters University so I\\'ll see if it has the same issue or maybe just affecting some titles.Fix for me was changing from US English to UK English on account. Then I had to restart the film with the restart button. Resuming it just continued it in French which was the expected outcome.Just talked to live support again about this issue...\"I do apologize this is a issue we are aware of and have our developers working to be able to provide a resolution.Again I apologize for the inconvenience, stay alert for any updates for the app that may go out once we have a fix.\"I then asked which social media avenues should I follow to \\'stay alert\\' for any updates. \\'Kelsey\\' said there was no specific news but just to watch for an app update. I followed up again with this Reddit thread noting it had been more than a month with no fix. She apologized again. I replied with the hope that she would escalate this and recognize that every other major streaming service maintains both English and French Canadian content libraries without issue. She politely thanked me for my concern and time and ended the chat.Very frustrating.I\\'m in Canada and I\\'m getting the French text and audio. The way I fixed it was I had someone I know that WASN\\'T having this issue send me their URL. So if you want the English version, here it is.  [https://www.disneyplus.com/video/f4add311-5f2a-4d79-a6c3-588a1765b7d9](https://www.disneyplus.com/video/f4add311-5f2a-4d79-a6c3-588a1765b7d9)I think it\\'s really sad that its March 2020 now and this simple problem still has not been fixed. I tried all the previously suggested fixes below. The problem is definitely related to the software. On my mobile device and on my computer, I do not have this problem at all. On my Smart TV and PS4 (where it matters!) the problem is there. My inquires to Disney+ continue to go unanswered. Really frustrating that this is happening..Noticed it watching A New Hope as well.Noticed the same thing for some pixar movies and shorts like Finding Nemo and Partly CloudyYup. Just finished watching monsters Inc and noticed that the magazine cover near the end was French, then the credits started in French before switching back to English at some point. Very strange.Yep, just put on Star Wars: Episode IV and the opening was in French.. sigh.French?!, it\\'s a Law-forsaken joke is what it is.Same issue right now.  Playing on an Amazon FireTV.   I had similar issues with Amazon’s Prime Video where I would start a movie and it would default to something like Turkish but that was a while ago and it’s been good lately.Same issue on Apple TV 4K.  Based in Ontario but getting French versions with English audio.  The log out / login trick doesn’t work for me.  Hopefully this is fixed soon.I was having same issue with fire stick 4k and I have figured a way to work around it.  If you look up the movie in the Prime video app then click \"watch in Disney+\" that made the opening crawl in English.Start Wars IV A New Hope is unwatchable here in Ontario\\\\- English Audio \\\\- opening text crawl in French\\\\- no subtitles for Greedo-languageSame problems here.I\\'ve waited to chat with them two or three times for many hours.  Has anyone ever gotten through to them?Edit: Fixed now.   I had English (UK) on one device and English (US) on another.  I played around with switching languages and trying it again.  All is good now, but not sure if switching languages had any affect.  They are all back to the way they were when I started.  I wasn\\'t able to reproduce the problem.Same problem. Located in Vancouver and I’m really confused why dialogue is English but text card at the start is French.Edit: when I changed my settings from English(UK) to English(US) it solved the problem for me.I was watching Monsters, Inc and the into and credits were in French with all the audio being English.I got it while watching A Christmas Carol today. In Ontario on a Roku.Question for everybody: how close to Quebec do you live?It must be a glitch. I had the same problem with the French words at the beginning (of every star wars movie). So I stopped the movie, so this post about it in Reddit (no help lol) checked the Disney plus app settings (also no help...) So I decided to just watch the movie anyways, however when I went back to the movie it started itself from the beginning but with English words. Very strange glitch that seemed to randomly fix itself this one time.There ate 2 versions of each show! One with French text the other English! There is barely any visible distinction between them when you select the movieSo I actually saw this happen as far back as several months ago, when watching Zootopia on Netflix. English audio, but signposts and other things with script on them were in French. I just finished watching Monster\\'s Inc, and near the tail end of the film I saw the same thing happen with certain things that were written in English, and other things written in French for some odd reason (within the same version of the film which is REALLY weird >.>) I still have no clue. Even if they were just dubbing the French versions of the films with English, that would make no sense because Disney usually does go to the effort of re-animating scenes with proper lip sync - and the lip syncing to English is on point in these movies, it\\'s just things that are written down that are in French. And that still doesn\\'t explain why some things are written in English and others in French. It just seems really weird to me, idk.I’m having the same problem going to try on site instead of an app but no luck regardless of the settings it’s still in French for me. Located in Nova ScotiaYeah I got that as well lmaoI ended up having to scrub through to the end of the French version before I could attempt to watch again in English. The restart button didn\\'t change anything.I was already on English US, but switched to UK and then back and after a system restart (and scrubbing to the end of the French version) I now have English. At least for A New Hope. Haven\\'t noticed other movies doing it yet.getting this glitch on Atlantis: The Lost Empire now, nothing seems to fix it, but tried Treasure Planet and it works finehaving the same issue watching from my pc. Watched episodes 1-3 on my 4k tv and no issues. so weird.Its been almost a month and I’m still getting this on my Roku :(On iPad:Settings >> General >> Language & Region >> iPad Language >> English (UK)Same problem with Last Jedi and Clone Wars. It was ok for Force Awakens, Mandalorian, others.I am having the same issues; only thing that has worked for me is to verbally speaking into the Fire Stick TV 4K mic and play movie that way, and everything is English.  Very annoying though.Yep can\\'t believe this is still an issueChat support today[https://i.imgur.com/9Vrh2z3.png](https://i.imgur.com/9Vrh2z3.png)[https://i.imgur.com/YmxH0Wm.png](https://i.imgur.com/YmxH0Wm.png)Just got off chat support and they said it was a known issue on their end. Dec. 31 2019Does anyone have a solution for this? I’m using a Sony TV and I can’t seem to get it working. Only way thus far is to stream from my phone - how annoying!Can’t figure out how to post a picture but this is the text I got from the chat support.“I guess this is another report that I need to escalate to our team, since it’s not only the Star Wars that are having this concern. We are basically having this issue, specifically for our customers from Canada. Our team is working on a fix for the issue. It’s something we aren’t able to troubleshoot at this time. It should be fixed relatively soon “I can\\'t find a fix for this on PS4. I\\'ve tried changing from English USA to English UK on PS4 and that didn\\'t work. Pretty frustrating.Spoke to chat support today. They still seem to have no idea how to fix this unfortunately. Apparently everyone in Canada is supposed to speak fluent French!I tested A New Hope and Tangled (both were French before) but are now English.  I did previously log out and reset my internet—I don’t know if that had any impact.Had this problem today watching starwars, posted a workaround for amazon fire tv: https://www.reddit.com/r/canadacordcutters/comments/dxiuzp/disney_star_wars_a_new_hope_text_in_french_only/fczxirr?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=shareThey need to split the English and French prints apart, just like what Netflix did.Having the same issue, with the majority of the movies.There’s 2 versions of the movie on there same titles one is English and the other is French for in movie text you just gotta find the English oneI just got Disney+ a few days ago, having the same issue but only on some videos. Others are in English. Watching in my browser.[removed]This happens on more tha  just starwars for me. Many Pixar films do this :( its annoyingI may have solved the problem. App language is set to English (US). The Apple TV “Language and Region” is set to English US and Region Canada.The best movie I’ve tried this with is The Little Mermaid. But to test you cannot go to the last watched movie. You need to search and select the movie from there. There is a French text and English text version in their online archive and if you watch both, they will both be in the continue watching area. So you need to make sure to search and see which one pops up.Same that happened to me on revenge of the sithI experienced this issue with Finding Nemo last night on the Sony TV D+ app. I also see the same issue on the website. Loaded up A New Hope, the intro crawl is all in French. Very disappointed this is happening, and I hope it\\'s rectified soon.And this is why im not giving them any money after my free trial.I just finished up trying to get support from Disney. They acknowledged the issue however these shared there is nothing they can do and expect me to pay full price for a defective experience. Profits over customer experience.This happened to me on A new hope, any luck fixing it?Netflix and prime both actually have the same issue it’s a Canadian thing because one of our official languages is French it’s easier to get away with double dipping some titlesWhere this becomes a big problem like a seriously huge problem is when you have someone on screen speaking a fictional language the subtitles come up in French. Same with protagonists reading signs if it’s animated the signs are also in French.I’m watching a new hope right now and the audio track is french. There is no way to change it. Frustrating.Just slide from \"Revenge of the Sith\" seamlessly into \"Un nouvel espoire\". Sith like that doesn\\'t just happen. Someone is seriously asleep at the helm.Hey Disney+ get your SITH together ....lol I just started up ANH and it\\'s in freaking French! lmaoOk I fixed it on my phone. All I did was go into settings and change my language to English UK and it is now all in English. Hope this works for you guys too.We just signed up for Disney Plus and wanted to watch the Star Wars movies (As I haven\\'t seen any before) and the opening scrawl is in Fenchlol just started watching return of the jedi. Intro \"a galaxy far far away\" and  yellow story intro writing is all french but then all subtitles when they are at Jabba\\'s is in English. What a mess 🤦\\u200d♂\\u200d[removed]same lolChecking in 3 months later. A New Hope is still French textAre you watching on an iOS device?Lol wtf?! There’s ONE French speaking province in Canada.. yes we’re all taught in in school.. that doesn’t mean we all speak it.. 🤣I\\'m playing it on my PS4, and going to the Star Wars section to.>Four months later and this worked for me for me. A google search brought me here.  >  >I can’t believe this bug has lasted this long.Doesn\\'t work no matter what I do with the profile. I think it\\'s just a location tag thing on their back end. Took 30 minutes tonight jumping through hoops with their chat support for them to finally escalate it to the engineers. The video file that is being distributed is French content, while the audio is English. How hard is it to figure out this is a distribution issue on the backend?True heroes do existUpdate: so far Monsters University is okay, I\\'m about 20 minutes in but no issues yet.As of last week I was still having the same issue...Very nice, it works, THANKS.Thank you so much!! That worked a treat.I got Spanish for the opening text. I\\'m in Canada too so I would expect the French.Ditto. Have you found a solution?I\\'ll have to try that!Thank you for this! I was able to fix this problem with something similar on Roku TV: search from the main screen (I used the mic button) and open the movie in Disney+ from the search results.Confirmed this works, tried changing app and FireTv languages no go. Search from FireTv and click play on Disney+ and French is gone!Lol unwatchableNew BrunswickAlberta. Still got French text and titles scattered through everything.Me too. I live in Quebec.TorontoWindsor, ON. 10 hours away!No. Just checked. There is only one version of each of the star wars movies, and they are all french.I just watch the English text on YouTube along with the movieThis is somewhat hopeful!Lmfao..what a fricking joke.

It runs Android.Northern Ontario and New Brunswick would like a quick chat.*taught in school* secondary language. OofA couple of other things I did before playing the movie again: logged out then logged back in.  I also switched profiles. My wife and I watched a movie with her profile, then after that was done, I went back to mine and A New Hope was now showing as 4K and Dolby Atmos when before it was only showing up as HD and had the opening crawl in French.3 hours and counting ....Had no issues on Monster\\'s Inc or Monsters University, But Zootopia is where I noticed it.It seems to have resolved itself. They probably fixed whatever the regional issue was.Saskatchewan.Never had an issue with that one. Those settings I had as English by default system level and within app (swiping down on my Apple TV remote)Dang that sucks, guess I’ll have to watch the opening on youtubeIm also having that issue now.  Day after i commented it startedI actually checked yesterday and they have 2 different videos up. 1 eng 1frenchTry changing the language from \"English (Canada)\" to \"English (UK)\". I\\'m not sure, but this setting might be found by navigating to: Settings >> General management >> Language and input. Good luck!who?Dude that is less than 1% of our population.Thanks! We\\'ll try this!Thanks, this worked for me. I only have one profile so I created another one.Holy... They must be really busynot for me. i’m on apple tv 4k as well and i’m watching cars 3 with a lot of text in french. i’m confused on how to fixMine was still French this morning. Guess I just have to wait it out.It happened before with clone wars but it turns out there was two different versions, one tench one English. But with a new hope it’s all FrenchI did that. Unfortunately it\\'s no different.Starlord, man!People who live in those provinces? Or French speakers? My comment was just highlighting that there are a lot more areas that have French speakers (like Gaspe, NCR, or a lot of Winnipeg) than just Quebec.French is the mother tongue of 21% of Canadians. English is the mother tongue of 56% of Canadians. So pretty significant, dude.22 days and counting?  xD  They kept him tied up so long he withered away.I like how just from that also happening to my service I’m done with it. It’s just not a thing you over look for a streaming service. A real shame and disappointment honestly but if you’re a billion dollar company why are you over looking the English languageWell the Gaspe is in Quebec. Half of the NCR is in Quebec. There are pockets of francophones spread throughout the country, but those pockets are a very small percentage of the national population. I was wrong in my initial estimate though, it\\'s closer to 4% than 1% of the national population outside Quebec that uses French as their first official language (2011 data). My point, and the point of others is: If I\\'m paying for a service I want that service to be provided in my official language, English. This is my right as a Canadian.I got through on Chat today and they finally agreed to look into it. They said it should be resolved within 5 to 10 business days...we will see.still not resolvedJust watch the title cards on youtube then go watch the rest of the movie that\\'s what I\\'m doingThere\\'s no excuse with all the complaints coming in after they have acknowledged the problem and promised to address it. Not okay.Still not resolved...'"
